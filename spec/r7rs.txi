Chapters @ref{Expressions} and @ref{Program structure} describe
the syntax and semantics of expressions, definitions, programs, and libraries.

Chapter @ref{Standard procedures} describes Scheme's built-in

@cindex @w{introduction}



Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very small number
of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language
that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
paradigms in use today.

Scheme
was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first-class
procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of
static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language.
Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical
environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position
of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position.  By relying
entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the
fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are essentially GOTOs that
pass arguments, thus allowing a programming style that is both coherent
and efficient.  Scheme was the first widely used programming language to
embrace first-class escape procedures, from which all previously known
sequential control structures can be synthesized.  A subsequent
version of Scheme introduced the concept of exact and inexact numbers,
an extension of Common Lisp's generic arithmetic.
More recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support
hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block-structured language
to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.
@ignore todo
Ramsdell:
I would like to make a few comments on presentation.  The most
important comment is about section organization.  Newspaper writers
spend most of their time writing the first three paragraphs of any
article.  This part of the article is often the only part read by
readers, and is important in enticing readers to continue.  In the
same way, The first page is most likely to be the only page read by
many SIGPLAN readers.  If I had my choice of what I would ask them to
read, it would be the material in section 1.1, the Semantics section
that notes that scheme is lexically scoped, tail-recursive, weakly
typed, ... etc.  I would expand on the discussion on continuations,
as they represent one important difference between Scheme and other
languages.  The introduction, with its history of scheme, its history
of scheme reports and meetings, and acknowledgments giving names of
people that the reader will not likely know, is not that one page I
would like all to read.  I suggest moving the history to the back of
the report, and use the first couple of pages to convince the reader
that the language documented in this report is worth studying.

@unnumberedsec Background

@cindex @w{background}

The first description of Scheme was written in
1975 [Scheme75].  A revised report [Scheme78]
appeared in 1978, which described the evolution
of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
innovative compiler [Rabbit].  Three distinct projects began in
1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University [Rees82], [MITScheme], [Scheme311].  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
1984 [SICP].

As Scheme became more widespread,
local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
sites.
Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
standard for Scheme.
Their report, the RRRS [RRRS],
was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
Further revision took place in the spring of 1986, resulting in the
R@sup{3}RS [R3RS].
Work in the spring of 1988 resulted in R@sup{4}RS [R4RS],
which became the basis for the
IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language in 1991 [IEEEScheme].
In 1998, several additions to the IEEE standard, including high-level
hygienic macros, multiple return values, and @samp{eval}, were finalized
as the R@sup{5}RS [R5RS].

@ignore todo
Perhaps flesh out a little and mention the forming of the
 Steering Committee.
@end ignore


In the fall of 2006, work began on a more ambitious standard,
including many new improvements and stricter requirements made in the
interest of improved portability.  The resulting standard, the
R@sup{6}RS, was completed in August 2007 [R6RS], and was organized
as a core language and set of mandatory standard libraries.  
Several new implementations of Scheme conforming to it were created.
However, most existing R@sup{5}RS implementations (even excluding those
which are essentially unmaintained) did not adopt R@sup{6}RS, or adopted
only selected parts of it.

In consequence, the Scheme Steering Committee decided in August 2009 to divide the
standard into two separate but compatible languages --- a ``small''
language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages,
focused on R@sup{5}RS compatibility, and a ``large'' language focused
on the practical needs of mainstream software development,
intended to become a replacement for R@sup{6}RS.
The present report describes the ``small'' language of that effort:
therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the successor
to R@sup{6}RS.

@cindex @w{semantics}


This section gives an overview of Scheme's semantics.  A
detailed informal semantics is the subject of
chapters @ref{Basic concepts} through @ref{Standard procedures}.  For reference
purposes, section @ref{Formal semantics} provides a formal
semantics of Scheme.

Scheme is a statically scoped programming
language.  Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically
apparent binding of that variable.

Scheme is a dynamically typed language.  Types
are associated with values (also called objects) rather than
@cindex @w{object}
with variables.  
Statically typed languages, by contrast, associate types with
variables and expressions as well as with values.

All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent.
No Scheme object is ever destroyed.  The reason that
implementations of Scheme do not (usually!) run out of storage is that
they are permitted to reclaim the storage occupied by an object if
they can prove that the object cannot possibly matter to any future
computation.  

Implementations of Scheme are required to be properly tail-recursive.
This allows the execution of an iterative computation in constant space,
even if the iterative computation is described by a syntactically
recursive procedure.  Thus with a properly tail-recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure-call
mechanics, so that special iteration constructs are useful only as
syntactic sugar.  See section @ref{Proper tail recursion}.

Scheme procedures are objects in their own right.  Procedures can be
created dynamically, stored in data structures, returned as results of
procedures, and so on.  

One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations, which
in most other languages only operate behind the scenes, also have
``first-class'' status.  Continuations are useful for implementing a
wide variety of advanced control constructs, including non-local exits,
backtracking, and coroutines.  See section @ref{Control features}.

Arguments to Scheme procedures are always passed by value, which
means that the actual argument expressions are evaluated before the
procedure gains control, regardless of whether the procedure needs the
result of the evaluation.  

Scheme's model of arithmetic is designed to remain as independent as
possible of the particular ways in which numbers are represented within a
computer. In Scheme, every integer is a rational number, every rational is a
real, and every real is a complex number.  Thus the distinction between integer
and real arithmetic, so important to many programming languages, does not
appear in Scheme.  In its place is a distinction between exact arithmetic,
which corresponds to the mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic on
approximations.  Exact arithmetic is not limited to integers.

@node Syntax, Notation and terminology, Semantics, Overview of Scheme
@section Syntax

@cindex @w{syntax}

Scheme, like most dialects of Lisp, employs a fully parenthesized prefix
notation for programs and other data; the grammar of Scheme generates a
sublanguage of the language used for data.  An important
consequence of this simple, uniform representation is that
Scheme programs and data can easily be treated uniformly by other Scheme programs.
For example, the @samp{eval} procedure evaluates a Scheme program expressed
as data.

The @samp{read} procedure performs syntactic as well as lexical decomposition of
the data it reads.  The @samp{read} procedure parses its input as data
(section @pxref{External representation}), not as program.

The formal syntax of Scheme is described in section @ref{Formal syntax}.

Every identifier defined in this report appears in one or more of several
@dfn{libraries}.  Identifiers defined in the @dfn{base library}
@cindex @w{base library}
@cindex @w{libraries}
are not marked specially in the body of the report.  
This library includes the core syntax of Scheme
and generally useful procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the
variable @samp{abs} is bound to a
procedure of one argument that computes the absolute value of a
number, and the variable @samp{+} is bound to a procedure that computes
sums.  The full list 
all the standard libraries and the identifiers they export is given in
Appendix @ref{Standard Libraries}.

All implementations of Scheme:


@itemize @bullet


@item
Must provide the base library and all the identifiers
exported from it.

@item
May provide or omit the other
libraries given in this report, but each library must either be provided
in its entirety, exporting no additional identifiers, or else omitted
altogether.

@item
May provide other libraries not described in this report.

@item
May also extend the function of any identifier in this
report, provided the extensions are not in conflict with the language
reported here.

@item
Must support portable
code by providing a mode of operation in which the lexical syntax does
not conflict with the lexical syntax described in this report.

@end itemize


@node Error situations and unspecified behavior, Entry format, Base and optional features, Notation and terminology
@subsection Error situations and unspecified behavior

@cindex @w{error situations and unspecified behavior}



@cindex @w{error}
When speaking of an error situation, this report uses the phrase ``an
error is signaled'' to indicate that implementations must detect and
report the error.
An error is signaled by raising a non-continuable exception, as if by
the procedure @samp{raise} as described in section @ref{Exceptions}.  The object raised is implementation-dependent
and need not be distinct from objects previously used for the same purpose.
In addition to errors signaled in situations described in this
report, programmers can signal their own errors and handle signaled errors.

The phrase ``an error that satisfies @emph{predicate} is signaled'' means that an error is
signaled as above.  Furthermore, if the object that is signaled is
passed to the specified predicate (such as @samp{file-error?} or @samp{read-error?}), the predicate returns @t{#t}.

If such wording does not appear in the discussion of
an error, then implementations are not required to detect or report the
error, though they are encouraged to do so.
Such a situation is sometimes, but not always, referred to with the phrase
``an error.''
In such a situation, an implementation may or may not signal an error;
if it does signal an error, the object that is signaled may or may not
satisfy the predicates @samp{error-object?}, @samp{file-error?}, or
@samp{read-error?}.
Alternatively, implementations may provide non-portable extensions.

For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an argument of a type that
the procedure is not explicitly specified to handle, even though such
domain errors are seldom mentioned in this report.  Implementations may
signal an error,
extend a procedure's domain of definition to include such arguments,
or fail catastrophically.

This report uses the phrase ``may report a violation of an
implementation restriction'' to indicate circumstances under which an
implementation is permitted to report that it is unable to continue
execution of a correct program because of some restriction imposed by the
implementation.  Implementation restrictions are discouraged,
but implementations are encouraged to report violations of implementation
restrictions.
@cindex @w{implementation restriction}

For example, an implementation may report a violation of an
implementation restriction if it does not have enough storage to run a
program,
or if an arithmetic operation would produce an exact number that is
too large for the implementation to represent.

If the value of an expression is said to be ``unspecified,'' then
the expression must evaluate to some object without signaling an error,
but the value depends on the implementation; this report explicitly does
not say what value is returned. 
@cindex @w{unspecified}

Finally, the words and phrases ``must,'' ``must not,'' ``shall,''
``shall not,'' ``should,'' ``should not,'' ``may,'' ``required,''
``recommended,'' and ``optional,'' although not capitalized in this
report, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].
They are used only with reference to implementer or implementation behavior,
not with reference to programmer or program behavior.



@node Entry format, Evaluation examples, Error situations and unspecified behavior, Notation and terminology
@subsection Entry format

@cindex @w{entry format}

Chapters @ref{Expressions} and @ref{Standard procedures} are organized
into entries.  Each entry describes one language feature or a group of
related features, where a feature is either a syntactic construct or a
procedure.  An entry begins with one or more header lines of the form


@noindent
@deffn {@var{category}} @var{template}

@end deffn

for identifiers in the base library, or


@noindent
@deffn {@var{name} library @var{category}} @var{template}

@end deffn

where @var{name} is the short name of a library
as defined in Appendix @ref{Standard Libraries}.

If @var{category} is ``syntax,'' the entry describes an expression
type, and the template gives the syntax of the expression type.
Components of expressions are designated by syntactic variables, which
are written using angle brackets, for example @r{<expression>} and
@r{<variable>}.  Syntactic variables are intended to denote segments of
program text; for example, @r{<expression>} stands for any string of
characters which is a syntactically valid expression.  The notation

@format
 @r{<thing1>} @dots{}
@end format

indicates zero or more occurrences of a @r{<thing>}, and

@format
 @r{<thing1>} @r{<thing2>} @dots{}
@end format

indicates one or more occurrences of a @r{<thing>}.

If @var{category} is ``auxiliary syntax,'' then the entry describes a
syntax binding that occurs only as part of specific surrounding
expressions. Any use as an independent syntactic construct or
variable is an error.

If @var{category} is ``procedure,'' then the entry describes a procedure, and
the header line gives a template for a call to the procedure.  Argument
names in the template are @var{italicized}.  Thus the header line


@noindent
@deffn {procedure} (vector-ref @var{vector} @var{k})

@end deffn

indicates that the procedure bound to the @t{vector-ref} variable takes
two arguments, a vector @var{vector} and an exact non-negative integer
@var{k} (see below).  The header lines


@noindent

@deffn {procedure} (make-vector @var{k})


@deffnx {procedure} (make-vector @var{k} @var{fill})

@end deffn

indicate that the @t{make-vector} procedure must be defined to take
either one or two arguments.


It is an error for a procedure to be presented with an argument that it
is not specified to handle.  For succinctness, we follow the convention
that if an argument name is also the name of a type listed in
section @ref{Disjointness of types}, then it is an error if that argument is not of the named type.
For example, the header line for @t{vector-ref} given above dictates that the
first argument to @t{vector-ref} is a vector.  The following naming
conventions also imply type restrictions:
@c \newcommand{\foo}[1]{\vr{#1}, \vri{#1}, $\ldots$ \vrj{#1}, $\ldots$}


@center @c begin-tabular
@quotation
@table @asis
@item @var{alist}
association list (list of pairs)
@item @var{boolean}

@item @var{bytevector}

@item @var{char}

@item @var{letter}

@item @var{list}, @var{list1}, @dots{} @var{listj}, @dots{}

@item @var{n}, @var{n1}, @dots{} @var{nj}, @dots{}

@item @var{z}, @var{z1}, @dots{} @var{zj}, @dots{}

@item 
@end table
@end quotation




The names @var{start} and @var{end} are used as indexes into strings,
vectors, and bytevectors.  Their use implies the following:



@itemize @bullet


@item It is an error if @var{start} is greater than @var{end}.

@item It is an error if @var{end} is greater than the length of the
string, vector, or bytevector.

@item If @var{start} is omitted, it is assumed to be zero.

@item If @var{end} is omitted, it assumed to be the length of the string,
vector, or bytevector.

@item The index @var{start} is always inclusive and the index @var{end} is always
exclusive.  As an example, consider a string.  If
@var{start} and @var{end} are the same, an empty
substring is referred to, and if @var{start} is zero and @var{end} is
the length of @var{string}, then the entire string is referred to.

The symbol ``@result{}'' used in program examples is read
``evaluates to.''  For example,


@example

(* 5 8)                                ==>  40

@end example


means that the expression @t{(* 5 8)} evaluates to the object @t{40}.
Or, more precisely:  the expression given by the sequence of characters
``@t{(* 5 8)}'' evaluates, in an environment containing the base library, to an object
that can be represented externally by the sequence of characters ``@t{40}.''  See section @ref{External representations} for a discussion of external
representations of objects.

By convention, @code{?} is the final character of the names

of procedures that always return a boolean value.
Such procedures are called @dfn{predicates}.

Predicates are generally understood to be side-effect free, except that they

Such procedures are called @dfn{mutation procedures}.
@cindex @w{mutation procedures}
The value returned by a mutation procedure is unspecified.

By convention, ``@code{->}'' appears within the names of procedures that
@vindex @w{->}
take an object of one type and return an analogous object of another type.
For example, @samp{list->vector} takes a list and returns a vector whose
elements are the same as those of the list.

@cindex @w{lexical conventions}

This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
Scheme, see section @ref{Formal syntax}.

@node Identifiers, Whitespace and comments, Lexical conventions, Lexical conventions
@section Identifiers

@cindex @w{identifiers}


An identifier is any sequence of letters, digits, and
@cindex @w{identifier}
``extended identifier characters'' provided that it does not have a prefix
which is a valid number.  
However, the  @code{.} token (a single period) used in the list syntax
@vindex @w{.}
is not an identifier.

All implementations of Scheme must support the following extended identifier
characters:


@example

! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @@ ^ _ ~ 
@end example


Alternatively, an identifier can be represented by a sequence of zero or more
characters enclosed within vertical lines (@samp{|}), analogous to
string literals.  Any character, including whitespace characters, but
excluding the backslash and vertical line characters,
can appear verbatim in such an identifier.
In addition, characters can be
specified using either an <inline hex escape> or
the same escapes
available in strings.

For example, the
identifier |H\x65;llo| is the same identifier as
Hello, and in an implementation that supports the appropriate
Unicode character the identifier |\x3BB;| is the same as the
identifier lambda.
What is more, |\t\t| and |\x9;\x9;| are the
same.
Note that || is a valid identifier that is different from any other
identifier.

Here are some examples of identifiers:


@example

...                      +
+soup+                   <=?
->string                 a34kTMNs
lambda                   list->vector
q                        V17a
|two words|              |two\x20;words|
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings

@end example


See section @ref{Lexical structure} for the formal syntax of identifiers.

Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:


@itemize @bullet

@item
Any identifier can be used as a variable
or as a syntactic keyword
(see sections @pxref{Variables; syntactic keywords; and regions} and @pxref{Macros}).

@item
When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
(see section @pxref{Literal expressions}), it is being used to denote a @emph{symbol}
(see section @pxref{Symbols}).

@end itemize

@cindex @w{syntactic keyword}
@cindex @w{variable}

In contrast with earlier revisions of the report [R5RS], the
syntax distinguishes between upper and lower case in
identifiers and in characters specified using their names.  However, it
does not distinguish between upper and lower case in numbers,
nor in <inline hex escapes> used
in the syntax of identifiers, characters, or strings.
None of the identifiers defined in this report contain upper-case
characters, even when they appear to do so as a result
of the English-language convention of capitalizing the first word of
a sentence.

The following directives give explicit control over case
folding.


@samp{}#!fold-case
@samp{}#!no-fold-case
@vindex #!no-fold-case
@vindex #!fold-case

These directives can appear anywhere comments are permitted (see
section @pxref{Whitespace and comments}) but must be followed by a delimiter.
They are treated as comments, except that they affect the reading
of subsequent data from the same port. The @samp{}#!fold-case directive causes
subsequent identifiers and character names to be case-folded
as if by @samp{string-foldcase} (see section @pxref{Strings}).
It has no effect on character
literals.  The @samp{}#!no-fold-case directive
causes a return to the default, non-folding behavior.
@end (NULL)



@node Whitespace and comments, Other notations, Identifiers, Lexical conventions
@section Whitespace and comments

@cindex @w{whitespace and comments}


@dfn{Whitespace} characters include the space, tab, and newline characters.
@cindex @w{whitespace}
(Implementations may provide additional whitespace characters such
as page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace can occur between any two tokens,
but not within a token.  Whitespace occurring inside a string
or inside a symbol delimited by vertical lines
is significant.

The lexical syntax includes several comment forms.  
Comments are treated exactly like whitespace.

A semicolon (@t{;}) indicates the start of a line
comment.  The comment continues to the
@cindex @w{;}
@cindex @w{comment}
end of the line on which the semicolon appears.  

Another way to indicate a comment is to prefix a @r{<datum>}
(cf.@: section @pxref{External representation}) with @t{#;} and optional
@vindex #;
<whitespace>.  The comment consists of
the comment prefix @t{#;}, the space, and the @r{<datum>} together.  This
notation is useful for ``commenting out'' sections of code.

Block comments are indicated with properly nested @t{#|}
@cindex @w{"|#@@@t{@t{|}#}}
@cindex @w{#"|@@@t{#@t{|}}}
and @t{|#} pairs.


@example

#|
   The FACT procedure computes the factorial
   of a non-negative integer.
|#
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        #;(= n 1)
        1        ;Base case: return 1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
section @ref{Numbers}.


@table @t


@item @t{.@: + -}
These are used in numbers, and can also occur anywhere in an identifier.
A delimited plus or minus sign by itself
is also an identifier.
A delimited period (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used
in the notation for pairs (section @pxref{Pairs and lists}), and to indicate a
rest-parameter in a  formal parameter list (section @pxref{Procedures}).
Note that a sequence of two or more periods @emph{is} an identifier.

@item @t{( )}
Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
(section @pxref{Pairs and lists}).

@item @t{'}
The apostrophe (single quote) character is used to indicate literal data (section @pxref{Literal expressions}).

@item @t{`}
The grave accent (backquote) character is used to indicate partly constant
data (section @pxref{Quasiquotation}).

@item @t{, ,@@}
The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in conjunction
with quasiquotation (section @pxref{Quasiquotation}).

@item @t{"}
The quotation mark character is used to delimit strings (section @pxref{Strings}).

@item \
Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
(section @pxref{Characters}) and as an escape character within string
constants (section @pxref{Strings}) and identifiers
(section @pxref{Lexical structure}).

@c  A box used because \verb is not allowed in command arguments.

@item @w{@t{[ ] @{ @}}}
Left and right square and curly brackets (braces)
are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.

@item #
 The number sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on
the character that immediately follows it:

@item @t{#t} @t{#f}
These are the boolean constants (section @pxref{Booleans}),
along with the alternatives @t{#true} and @t{#false}.

@item #\
This introduces a character constant (section @pxref{Characters}).

@item #@t{(}
This introduces a vector constant (section @pxref{Vectors}).  Vector constants
are terminated by @t{)} .

@item #@t{ u8(}
This introduces a bytevector constant (section @pxref{Bytevectors}).  Bytevector constants
are terminated by @t{)} .

@item @t{#e #i #b #o #d #x}
These are used in the notation for numbers (section @pxref{Syntax of numerical constants}).

@item @t{SHARP@r{<n>}= SHARP@r{<n>}#}
These are used for labeling and referencing other literal data (section @pxref{Datum labels}).

@end table


@node Datum labels,  , Other notations, Lexical conventions
@section Datum labels

@cindex @w{datum labels}



@deffn {lexical syntax} SHARP@r{<n>}=@r{<datum>}


@deffnx {lexical syntax} SHARP@r{<n>}#


The lexical syntax
@t{SHARP@r{<n>}=@r{<datum>}} reads the same as @r{<datum>}, but also
results in @r{<datum>} being labelled by @r{<n>}.
It is an error if @r{<n>} is not a sequence of digits.

The lexical syntax @t{SHARP@r{<n>}#} serves as a reference to some
object labelled by @t{SHARP@r{<n>}=}; the result is the same
object as the @t{SHARP@r{<n>}}= 
(see section @pxref{Equivalence predicates}). 

Together, these syntaxes permit the notation of
structures with shared or circular substructure.


@format
@t{(let ((x (list 'a 'b 'c)))
  (set-cdr! (cddr x) x)
  x)                                   ==> #0=(a b c . #0#)
}
@end format


The scope of a datum label is the portion of the outermost datum in which it appears
that is to the right of the label.
Consequently, a reference @t{SHARP@r{<n>}#} can occur only after a label
@t{SHARP@r{<n>}=}; it is an error to attempt a forward reference.  In
addition, it is an error if the reference appears as the labelled object itself
(as in @t{SHARP@r{<n>}= SHARP@r{<n>}#}),
because the object labelled by @t{SHARP@r{<n>}=} is not well
defined in this case.

It is an error for a @r{<program>} or @r{<library>} to include
circular references except in literals.  In particular,
it is an error for @samp{quasiquote} (section @pxref{Quasiquotation}) to contain them.


@format
@t{#1=(begin (display #\x) #1#)

@section Variables; syntactic keywords; and regions

@cindex @w{variables; syntactic keywords; and regions}



An identifier can name either a type of syntax or
@cindex @w{identifier}
a location where a value can be stored.  An identifier that names a type
of syntax is called a @emph{syntactic keyword}
@cindex @w{syntactic keyword}
and is said to be @emph{bound} to a transformer for that syntax.  An identifier that names a
location is called a @emph{variable} and is said to be
@cindex @w{variable}
@emph{bound} to that location.  The set of all visible
bindings in effect at some point in a program is
@cindex @w{binding}
known as the @emph{environment} in effect at that point.  The value
stored in the location to which a variable is bound is called the
variable's value.  By abuse of terminology, the variable is sometimes
said to name the value or to be bound to the value.  This is not quite
accurate, but confusion rarely results from this practice.

Certain expression types are used to create new kinds of syntax
and to bind syntactic keywords to those new syntaxes, while other
expression types create new locations and bind variables to those
locations.  These expression types are called @emph{binding constructs}.

@cindex @w{binding construct}
Those that bind syntactic keywords are listed in section @ref{Macros}.
The most fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the
@samp{lambda} expression, because all other variable binding constructs
(except top-level bindings)
can be explained in terms of @samp{lambda} expressions.  The other
variable binding constructs are @samp{let}, @samp{let*}, @samp{letrec},
@samp{letrec*}, @samp{let-values}, @samp{let*-values},
and @samp{do} expressions (see sections @pxref{Procedures}, @pxref{Binding constructs}, and
@pxref{Iteration}).

@c Note: internal definitions not mentioned here.

Scheme is a language with
block structure.  To each place where an identifier is bound in a program
there corresponds a @dfn{region} of the program text within which
@cindex @w{region}
the binding is visible.  The region is determined by the particular
binding construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is
established by a @samp{lambda} expression, for example, then its region
is the entire @samp{lambda} expression.  Every mention of an identifier
refers to the binding of the identifier that established the
innermost of the regions containing the use.  If there is no binding of
the identifier whose region contains the use, then the use refers to the
binding for the variable in the global environment, if any
(chapters @pxref{Expressions} and @pxref{Standard procedures}); if there is no
binding for the identifier,
it is said to be @dfn{unbound}.
@cindex @w{global environment}

@node Disjointness of types, External representations, Variables; syntactic keywords; and regions, Basic concepts
@section Disjointness of types

@cindex @w{disjointness of types}


No object satisfies more than one of the following predicates:


@example

boolean?          bytevector?
char?             eof-object?
null?             number?
pair?             port?
procedure?        string?
symbol?           vector?

@end example


and all predicates created by @samp{define-record-type}.

These predicates define the types 
@emph{boolean, bytevector, character}, the empty list object,
@emph{eof-object, number, pair, port, procedure, string, symbol, vector},
and all record types.

@vindex symbol?
@vindex pair?
@vindex boolean?
@cindex @w{type}

@vindex vector?
@vindex string?
@vindex char?
@vindex number?

@cindex @w{empty list}
@vindex procedure?
@vindex port?
@vindex bytevector?

@vindex eof-object?

Although there is a separate boolean type,
any Scheme value can be used as a boolean value for the purpose of a
conditional test.  As explained in section @ref{Booleans}, all
values count as true in such a test except for @t{#f}.
This report uses the word ``true'' to refer to any
Scheme value except @t{#f}, and the word ``false'' to refer to
@t{#f}.  
@cindex @w{false}
@cindex @w{true}

@node External representations, Storage model, Disjointness of types, Basic concepts
@section External representations

@cindex @w{external representations}


An important concept in Scheme (and Lisp) is that of the @emph{external
representation} of an object as a sequence of characters.  For example,
an external representation of the integer 28 is the sequence of
characters ``@t{28}'', and an external representation of a list consisting
of the integers 8 and 13 is the sequence of characters ``@t{(8 13)}''.

The external representation of an object is not necessarily unique.  The
integer 28 also has representations ``@t{#e28.000}'' and ``@t{#x1c}'', and the
list in the previous paragraph also has the representations ``@t{( 08 13
)}'' and ``@t{(8 .@: (13 .@: ()))}'' (see section @pxref{Pairs and lists}).

Many objects have standard external representations, but some, such as
procedures, do not have standard representations (although particular
implementations may define representations for them).

An external representation can be written in a program to obtain the
corresponding object (see @samp{quote}, section @pxref{Literal expressions}).

External representations can also be used for input and output.  The
procedure @samp{read} (section @pxref{Input}) parses external
representations, and the procedure @samp{write} (section @pxref{Output})
generates them.  Together, they provide an elegant and powerful
input/output facility.

Note that the sequence of characters ``@t{(+ 2 6)}'' is @emph{not} an
external representation of the integer 8, even though it @emph{is} an
expression evaluating to the integer 8; rather, it is an external
representation of a three-element list, the elements of which are the symbol
@t{+} and the integers 2 and 6.  Scheme's syntax has the property that
any sequence of characters that is an expression is also the external
representation of some object.  This can lead to confusion, since it is not always
obvious out of context whether a given sequence of characters is
intended to denote data or program, but it is also a source of power,
since it facilitates writing programs such as interpreters and
compilers that treat programs as data (or vice versa).

The syntax of external representations of various kinds of objects
accompanies the description of the primitives for manipulating the
objects in the appropriate sections of chapter @ref{Standard procedures}.

@node Storage model, Proper tail recursion, External representations, Basic concepts
@section Storage model

@cindex @w{storage model}


Variables and objects such as pairs, strings, vectors, and bytevectors implicitly
denote locations or sequences of locations.  A string, for
@cindex @w{location}
example, denotes as many locations as there are characters in the string. 
A new value can be
stored into one of these locations using the @t{string-set!} procedure, but
the string continues to denote the same locations as before.

An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by
a procedure such as @samp{car}, @samp{vector-ref}, or @samp{string-ref}, is
equivalent in the sense of @code{eqv?}
@vindex @w{eqv?}
(section @pxref{Equivalence predicates})
to the object last stored in the location before the fetch.

Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.
No variable or object ever refers to a location that is not in use.

Whenever this report speaks of storage being newly allocated for a variable
or object, what is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are
chosen from the set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen
locations are marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable
or object is made to denote them.
Notwithstanding this,
it is understood that the empty list cannot be newly allocated, because
it is a unique object.  It is also understood that empty strings, empty
vectors, and empty bytevectors, which contain no locations, may or may
not be newly allocated.

Every object that denotes locations is 
either mutable or
@cindex @w{mutable}
immutable.  Literal constants, the strings
@cindex @w{immutable}
returned by @code{symbol->string},
@vindex @w{symbol->string}
and possibly the environment returned by @samp{scheme-report-environment}
are immutable objects.  All objects
created by the other procedures listed in this report are mutable.
It is an
error to attempt to store a new value into a location that is denoted by an
immutable object.

@c % If an implementation makes it impossible for any program to alter an
@c % immutable object, it may treat the object as a value (similar to a
@c % number, boolean, symbol, or the empty list) rather than as a container
@c % for immutable locations.

@ignore todo
Shinn: The previous comment that it is an error to mutate these
  locations, combined with the following comment that they are only
  conceptual, makes this note seem unecessary.
@end ignore


These locations are to be understood as conceptual, not physical.
Hence, they do not necessarily correspond to memory addresses,
and even if they do, the memory address might not be constant.


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the values of
@cindex @w{constant}

@section Proper tail recursion

@cindex @w{proper tail recursion}


Implementations of Scheme are required to be
@emph{properly tail-recursive}.
Procedure calls that occur in certain syntactic
contexts defined below are @emph{tail calls}.  A Scheme implementation is
properly tail-recursive if it supports an unbounded number of active
tail calls.  A call is @emph{active} if the called procedure might still
return.  Note that this includes calls that might be returned from either
by the current continuation or by continuations captured earlier by
@samp{call-with-current-continuation} that are later invoked.
In the absence of captured continuations, calls could
return at most once and the active calls would be those that had not
yet returned.
A formal definition of proper tail recursion can be found
in [propertailrecursion].


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}

Intuitively, no space is needed for an active tail call because the
continuation that is used in the tail call has the same semantics as the
continuation passed to the procedure containing the call.  Although an improper
implementation might use a new continuation in the call, a return
to this new continuation would be followed immediately by a return
to the continuation passed to the procedure.  A properly tail-recursive
implementation returns to that continuation directly.

Proper tail recursion was one of the central ideas in Steele and
Sussman's original version of Scheme.  Their first Scheme interpreter
implemented both functions and actors.  Control flow was expressed using
actors, which differed from functions in that they passed their results
on to another actor instead of returning to a caller.  In the terminology
of this section, each actor finished with a tail call to another actor.

Steele and Sussman later observed that in their interpreter the code
for dealing with actors was identical to that for functions and thus
there was no need to include both in the language.

@end quotation


A @emph{tail call} is a procedure call that occurs
@cindex @w{tail call}
in a @emph{tail context}.  Tail contexts are defined inductively.  Note
that a tail context is always determined with respect to a particular lambda
expression.



@itemize @bullet

@item
The last expression within the body of a lambda expression,
shown as @r{<tail expression>} below, occurs in a tail context.
The same is true of all the bodies of @samp{case-lambda} expressions.

@format
@t{(lambda <formals>
  <definition>* <expression>* <tail expression>)

(case-lambda (<formals> <tail body>)*)
}

@end format



@item
If one of the following expressions is in a tail context,
then the subexpressions shown as <tail expression> are in a tail context.
These were derived from rules in the grammar given in
chapter @ref{Formal syntax and semantics} by replacing some occurrences of <body>
with <tail body>,  some occurrences of <expression>
with <tail expression>,  and some occurrences of <sequence>
with <tail sequence>.  Only those rules that contain tail contexts
are shown here.


@format
@t{(if <expression> <tail expression> <tail expression>)
(if <expression> <tail expression>)

(cond <cond clause>+)
(cond <cond clause>* (else <tail sequence>))

(case <expression>
  <case clause>+)
(case <expression>
  <case clause>*
  (else <tail sequence>))

(and <expression>* <tail expression>)
(or <expression>* <tail expression>)

(when <test> <tail sequence>)
(unless <test> <tail sequence>)

(let (<binding spec>*) <tail body>)
(let <variable> (<binding spec>*) <tail body>)
(let* (<binding spec>*) <tail body>)

(let-values (<mv binding spec>*) <tail body>)

(letrec-syntax (<syntax spec>*) <tail body>)

(begin <tail sequence>)

(do (<iteration spec>*)
    (<test> <tail sequence>)

@r{where}

<cond clause> --> (<test> <tail sequence>)
<case clause> --> ((<datum>*) <tail sequence>)

<tail body> --> <definition>* <tail sequence>
<tail sequence> --> <expression>* <tail expression>
}

@end format



@item 
If a @samp{cond} or @samp{case} expression is in a tail context, and has
a clause of the form @samp{(@r{<expression1>} => @r{<expression2>})}
then the (implied) call to
the procedure that results from the evaluation of @r{<expression2>} is in a
tail context.  @r{<expression2>} itself is not in a tail context.



@end itemize


Certain procedures defined in this report are also required to perform tail calls.
The first argument passed to @code{apply} and to
@vindex @w{apply}
@code{call-with-current-continuation}, and the second argument passed to
@vindex @w{call-with-current-continuation}
@code{call-with-values}, must be called via a tail call.
@vindex @w{call-with-values}
Similarly, @code{eval} must evaluate its first argument as if it
@vindex @w{eval}
were in tail position within the @code{eval} procedure.

In the following example the only tail call is the call to @samp{f}.
None of the calls to @samp{g} or @samp{h} are tail calls.  The reference to
@samp{x} is in a tail context, but it is not a call and thus is not a
tail call.

@example

(lambda ()
  (if (g)
      (let ((x (h)))
        x)
      (and (g) (f))))

@end example



@quotation
@emph{Note:}
Implementations may
recognize that some non-tail calls, such as the call to @samp{h}
above, can be evaluated as though they were tail calls.
In the example above, the @samp{let} expression could be compiled
as a tail call to @samp{h}. (The possibility of @samp{h} returning
an unexpected number of values can be ignored, because in that
case the effect of the @samp{let} is explicitly unspecified and
implementation-dependent.)

The procedures in this document are available as the values of variables exported by the
standard libraries.  For example, the addition and multiplication
procedures in the above examples are the values of the variables @samp{+}

(see section @pxref{Procedures}).

Procedure calls can return any number of values (see @code{values} in
@vindex @w{values}
section @pxref{Control features}).
Most of the procedures defined in this report return one
value or, for procedures such as @samp{apply}, pass on the values returned
by a call to one of their arguments.
Exceptions are noted in the individual descriptions.

Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of

@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Formals>} is a formal arguments list as described below,

followed by one or more expressions.

@emph{Semantics:}
A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in
effect when the lambda expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some actual
arguments, the environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated will
be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to
fresh locations, and the corresponding actual argument values will be stored
in those locations.
(A @dfn{fresh} location is one that is distinct from every previously
@cindex @w{fresh}
existing location.)
Next, the expressions in the
body of the lambda expression (which, if it contains definitions,
represents a @samp{letrec*} form --- see section @pxref{Binding constructs})
will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.
The results of the last expression in the body will be returned as
the results of the procedure call.

@item

If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
the procedure takes n or more arguments, where n is the
number of formal arguments before the period (it is an error if there is not
at least one).
The value stored in the binding of the last variable will be a
newly allocated
list of the actual arguments left over after all the other actual
arguments have been matched up against the other formal arguments.

@deffn {syntax} cond-expand  <ce-clause1> <ce-clause2> @dots{}

@emph{Syntax:}
The @code{cond-expand} expression type
@vindex @w{cond-expand}
provides a way to statically
expand different expressions depending on the
implementation.  A
@r{<ce-clause>} takes the following form:

@t{(@r{<feature requirement>} @r{<expression>} @dots{})}

The last clause can be an ``else clause,'' which has the form

@t{(else @r{<expression>} @dots{})}

A @r{<feature requirement>} takes one of the following forms:



@itemize @bullet

@item
@t{@r{<feature identifier>}}
@item
@t{(library @r{<library name>})}
@item
@t{(and @r{<feature requirement>} @dots{})}
@item
@t{(or @r{<feature requirement>} @dots{})}
@item
@t{(not @r{<feature requirement>})}

@end itemize


@emph{Semantics:}
Each implementation maintains a list of feature identifiers which are
present, as well as a list of libraries which can be imported.  The
value of a @r{<feature requirement>} is determined by replacing
each @r{<feature identifier>} and @t{(library @r{<library name>})}
on the implementation's lists with @t{#t}, and all other feature
identifiers and library names with @t{#f}, then evaluating the
resulting expression as a Scheme boolean expression under the normal
interpretation of @samp{and}, @samp{or}, and @samp{not}.

A @code{cond-expand} is then expanded by evaluating the
@r{<feature requirement>}s of successive @r{<ce-clause>}s
in order until one of them returns @t{#t}.  When a true clause is
found, the corresponding @r{<expression>}s are expanded to a
@samp{begin}, and the remaining clauses are ignored.
If none of the @r{<feature requirement>}s evaluate to @t{#t}, then
if there is an else clause, its @r{<expression>}s are
included.  Otherwise, the behavior of the @code{cond-expand} is unspecified.
Unlike @samp{cond}, @samp{cond-expand} does not depend on the value
of any variables.

The exact features provided are implementation-defined, but for
portability a core set of features is given in
appendix @ref{Standard Feature Identifiers}.

@node Binding constructs, Sequencing, Conditional, Derived expression types
@subsection Binding constructs

@cindex @w{binding constructs}


The binding constructs @samp{let}, @samp{let*}, @samp{letrec}, @samp{letrec*},
@samp{let-values}, and @samp{let*-values}
give Scheme a block structure, like Algol 60.  The syntax of the first four
constructs is identical, but they differ in the regions they establish
@cindex @w{region}
for their variable bindings.  In a @samp{let} expression, the initial
values are computed before any of the variables become bound; in a
@samp{let*} expression, the bindings and evaluations are performed
sequentially; while in @samp{letrec} and @samp{letrec*} expressions,
all the bindings are in
effect while their initial values are being computed, thus allowing
mutually recursive definitions.
The @samp{let-values} and @samp{let*-values} constructs are analogous to @samp{let} and @samp{let*}
respectively, but are designed to handle multiple-valued expressions, binding
different identifiers to the returned values.


@deffn {syntax} let  @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}

@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Bindings>} has the form

@format
@t{((@r{<variable1>} @r{<init1>}) @dots{})@r{,}
}
@end format

where each @r{<init>} is an expression, and @r{<body>} is a
sequence of zero or more definitions followed by a
sequence of one or more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}.  It is
an error for a @r{<variable>} to appear more than once in the list of variables
being bound.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @r{<init>}s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
unspecified order), the @r{<variable>}s are bound to fresh locations
holding the results, the @r{<body>} is evaluated in the extended
environment, and the values of the last expression of @r{<body>}
are returned.  Each binding of a @r{<variable>} has @r{<body>} as its
region.


@format
@t{(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (* x y))                             ==>  6

(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (let ((x 7)
        (z (+ x y)))
    (* z x)))                          ==>  35
}
@end format


See also ``named @samp{let},'' section @ref{Iteration}.

@end deffn



@deffn {syntax} let*  @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}


@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Bindings>} has the form

@format
@t{((@r{<variable1>} @r{<init1>}) @dots{})@r{,}
}
@end format

and @r{<body>} is a sequence of
zero or more definitions followed by
one or more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @samp{let*} binding construct is similar to @samp{let}, but the bindings are performed
sequentially from left to right, and the region of a binding indicated
by @samp{(@r{<variable>} @r{<init>})} is that part of the @samp{let*}
expression to the right of the binding.  Thus the second binding is done
in an environment in which the first binding is visible, and so on.
The @r{<variable>}s need not be distinct.


@format
@t{(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (let* ((x 7)
         (z (+ x y)))
    (* z x)))                          ==>  70
}
@end format


@end deffn



@deffn {syntax} letrec  @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}

@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Bindings>} has the form

@format
@t{((@r{<variable1>} @r{<init1>}) @dots{})@r{,}
}
@end format

and @r{<body>} is a sequence of
zero or more definitions followed by
one or more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}. It is an error for a @r{<variable>} to appear more
than once in the list of variables being bound.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @r{<variable>}s are bound to fresh locations holding unspecified
values, the @r{<init>}s are evaluated in the resulting environment (in
some unspecified order), each @r{<variable>} is assigned to the result
of the corresponding @r{<init>}, the @r{<body>} is evaluated in the
resulting environment, and the values of the last expression in
@r{<body>} are returned.  Each binding of a @r{<variable>} has the
entire @samp{letrec} expression as its region, making it possible to
define mutually recursive procedures.


@format
@t{(letrec ((even?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                #t
                (odd? (- n 1)))))
         (odd?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                #f
                (even? (- n 1))))))
  (even? 88))
                                       ==>  #t
}
@end format


One restriction on @samp{letrec} is very important: if it is not possible
to evaluate each @r{<init>} without assigning or referring to the value of any
@r{<variable>}, it is an error.  The
restriction is necessary because 
@samp{letrec} is defined in terms of a procedure
call where a @samp{lambda} expression binds the @r{<variable>}s to the values
of the @r{<init>}s.
In the most common uses of @samp{letrec}, all the @r{<init>}s are
lambda expressions and the restriction is satisfied automatically.

@end deffn



@deffn {syntax} letrec*  @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}


@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Bindings>} has the form

@format
@t{((@r{<variable1>} @r{<init1>}) @dots{})@r{,}
}
@end format

and @r{<body>} is a sequence of
@cindex @w{body}
zero or more definitions followed by
one or more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}. It is an error for a @r{<variable>} to appear more
than once in the list of variables being bound.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @r{<variable>}s are bound to fresh locations,
each @r{<variable>} is assigned in left-to-right order to the
result of evaluating the corresponding @r{<init>}
(interleaving evaluations and assignments),
the @r{<body>} is
evaluated in the resulting environment, and the values of the last
expression in @r{<body>} are returned.
Despite the left-to-right evaluation and assignment order, each binding of
a @r{<variable>} has the entire @samp{letrec*} expression as its
region, making it possible to define mutually recursive
procedures.

If it is not possible to evaluate each @r{<init>} without assigning or
referring to the value of the corresponding @r{<variable>} or the
@r{<variable>} of any of the bindings that follow it in
@r{<bindings>}, it is an error.
Another restriction is that it is an error to invoke the continuation
of an @r{<init>} more than once.


@format
@t{;; Returns the arithmetic, geometric, and
;; harmonic means of a nested list of numbers
(define (means ton)
  (letrec*
     ((mean
        (lambda (f g)
          (f (/ (sum g ton) n))))
      (sum
        (lambda (g ton)
          (if (null? ton)
            (+)
            (if (number? ton)
                (g ton)
                (+ (sum g (car ton))
                   (sum g (cdr ton)))))))
      (n (sum (lambda (x) 1) ton)))
    (values (mean values values)
            (mean exp log)
            (mean / /))))

Evaluating @samp{(means '(3 (1 4)))} returns three values:
8/3, 2.28942848510666 (approximately), and 36/19.


@deffnx {syntax} let-values  @r{<mv binding spec>} @r{<body>}

@emph{Syntax:}
@r{<Mv binding spec>} has the form

@format
@t{((@r{<formals1>} @r{<init1>}) @dots{})@r{,}
}
@end format


where each @r{<init>} is an expression, and @r{<body>} is
zero or more definitions followed by a sequence of one or
more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}.  It is an error for a variable to appear more than
once in the set of @r{<formals>}.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @r{<init>}s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
unspecified order) as if by invoking @samp{call-with-values}, and the
variables occurring in the @r{<formals>} are bound to fresh locations
holding the values returned by the @r{<init>}s, where the
@r{<formals>} are matched to the return values in the same way that
the @r{<formals>} in a @samp{lambda} expression are matched to the
arguments in a procedure call.  Then, the @r{<body>} is evaluated in
the extended environment, and the values of the last expression of
@r{<body>} are returned.  Each binding of a @r{<variable>} has
@r{<body>} as its region.

It is an error if the @r{<formals>} do not match the number of
values returned by the corresponding @r{<init>}.


@format
@t{(let-values (((root rem) (exact-integer-sqrt 32)))

}
@end format

and @r{<body>} is a sequence of zero or more
definitions followed by one or more expressions as described in section @ref{Procedures}.  In each @r{<formals>},
it is an error if any variable appears more than once.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @samp{let*-values} construct is similar to @samp{let-values}, but the
@r{<init>}s are evaluated and bindings created sequentially from
left to right, with the region of the bindings of each @r{<formals>}
including the @r{<init>}s to its right as well as @r{<body>}.  Thus the
second @r{<init>} is evaluated in an environment in which the first
set of bindings is visible and initialized, and so on.


@format
@t{(let ((a 'a) (b 'b) (x 'x) (y 'y))
  (let*-values (((a b) (values x y))
                ((x y) (values a b)))

@node Sequencing, Iteration, Binding constructs, Derived expression types
@subsection Sequencing

@cindex @w{sequencing}


Both of Scheme's sequencing constructs are named @samp{begin}, but the two
have slightly different forms and uses:


@deffn {syntax} begin  @r{<expression or definition>} @dots{}

This form of @samp{begin} can appear as part of a @r{<body>}, or at the
outermost level of a @r{<program>}, or at the REPL, or directly nested
in a @samp{begin} that is itself of this form.
It causes the contained expressions and definitions to be evaluated
exactly as if the enclosing @samp{begin} construct were not present.


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
This form is commonly used in the output of
macros (see section @pxref{Macros})
which need to generate multiple definitions and
splice them into the context in which they are expanded.
@end quotation


@end deffn


@deffn {syntax} begin  <expression1> <expression2> @dots{}

This form of @samp{begin} can be used as an ordinary expression.
The @r{<expression>}s are evaluated sequentially from left to right,
and the values of the last @r{<expression>} are returned. This
expression type is used to sequence side effects such as assignments
or input and output.


@format
@t{(define x 0)

(and (= x 0)
     (begin (set! x 5)

Note that there is a third form of @samp{begin} used as a library declaration:

@node Iteration, Delayed evaluation, Sequencing, Derived expression types
@subsection Iteration

@c \unsection

@cindex @w{iteration}

@noindent

@deffn {syntax} (do ((@r{<variable1>} @r{<init1>} @r{<step1>})

@t{ @dots{}) (@r{<test>} @r{<expression>} @dots{}) @r{<command>} @dots{})}
@cindex @w{do}

@emph{Syntax:}
All of @r{<init>}, @r{<step>}, @r{<test>}, and @r{<command>}
are expressions.

@emph{Semantics:}
A @samp{do} expression is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to
be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start, and how they are
to be updated on each iteration.  When a termination condition is met,
the loop exits after evaluating the @r{<expression>}s.

A @samp{do} expression is evaluated as follows:
The @r{<init>} expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
the @r{<variable>}s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
@r{<init>} expressions are stored in the bindings of the
@r{<variable>}s, and then the iteration phase begins.

Each iteration begins by evaluating @r{<test>}; if the result is
false (see section @pxref{Booleans}), then the @r{<command>}
expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the @r{<step>}
expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
@r{<variable>}s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
@r{<step>}s are stored in the bindings of the
@r{<variable>}s, and the next iteration begins.

If @r{<test>} evaluates to a true value, then the
@r{<expression>}s are evaluated from left to right and the values of
the last @r{<expression>} are returned.  If no @r{<expression>}s
are present, then the value of the @samp{do} expression is unspecified.

The region of the binding of a @r{<variable>}
@cindex @w{region}
consists of the entire @samp{do} expression except for the @r{<init>}s.
It is an error for a @r{<variable>} to appear more than once in the
list of @samp{do} variables.

A @r{<step>} can be omitted, in which case the effect is the
same as if @samp{(@r{<variable>} @r{<init>} @r{<variable>})} had
been written instead of @samp{(@r{<variable>} @r{<init>})}.


@format
@t{(do ((vec (make-vector 5))

@end format





@deffnx {syntax} let  @r{<variable>} @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}


@emph{Semantics:}
``Named @samp{let}'' is a variant on the syntax of @code{let} which provides
@vindex @w{let}
a more general looping construct than @samp{do} and can also be used to express
recursion.
It has the same syntax and semantics as ordinary @samp{let}
except that @r{<variable>} is bound within @r{<body>} to a procedure
whose formal arguments are the bound variables and whose body is
@r{<body>}.  Thus the execution of @r{<body>} can be repeated by
invoking the procedure named by @r{<variable>}.

@deffn {lazy library syntax} delay-force  @r{<expression>}

@ignore todo
Fix.
@end ignore


@emph{Semantics:}
The expression @samp{(delay-force @var{expression})} is conceptually similar to 
@samp{(delay (force @var{expression}))},
with the difference that forcing the result
of @samp{delay-force} will in effect result in a tail call to 
@samp{(force @var{expression})},
while forcing the result of
@samp{(delay (force @var{expression}))}
might not.  Thus
iterative lazy algorithms that might result in a long series of chains of
@samp{delay} and @samp{force}
can be rewritten using @samp{delay-force} to prevent consuming
unbounded space during evaluation.

@end deffn


@deffn {lazy library procedure} force  promise

The @samp{force} procedure forces the value of a @var{promise} created
by @code{delay}, @code{delay-force}, or @code{make-promise}.
@vindex @w{make-promise}
@vindex @w{delay-force}
@vindex @w{delay}
If no value has been computed for the promise, then a value is
computed and returned.  The value of the promise must be cached (or
``memoized'') so that if it is forced a second time, the previously
computed value is returned.
Consequently, a delayed expression is evaluated using the parameter
values and exception handler of the call to @samp{force} which first
requested its value.
If @var{promise} is not a promise, it may be returned unchanged.


@format
@t{(force (delay (+ 1 2)))                ==>  3
(let ((p (delay (+ 1 2))))

  (letrec ((next
            (lambda (n)
              (delay (cons n (next (+ n 1)))))))

(define head
  (lambda (stream) (car (force stream))))
(define tail

}
@end format


The following example is a mechanical transformation of a lazy
stream-filtering algorithm into Scheme.  Each call to a constructor is
wrapped in @samp{delay}, and each argument passed to a deconstructor is
wrapped in @samp{force}.  The use of @samp{(delay-force ...)} instead of @samp{(delay (force ...))} around the body of the procedure ensures that an
ever-growing sequence of pending promises does not 
exhaust available storage,
because @samp{force} will in effect force such sequences iteratively.


@format
@t{(define (stream-filter p? s)

The following examples are not intended to illustrate good programming
style, as @samp{delay}, @samp{force}, and @samp{delay-force} are mainly intended
for programs written in the functional style.
However, they do illustrate the property that only one value is
computed for a promise, no matter how many times it is forced.


@format
@t{(define count 0)
(define p
  (delay (begin (set! count (+ count 1))
                (if (> count x)
                    count
                    (force p)))))
(define x 5)
p                                      ==>  @i{}a promise
(force p)                              ==>  6
p                                      ==>  @i{}a promise, still
(begin (set! x 10)
       (force p))                      ==>  6
}
@end format


Various extensions to this semantics of @samp{delay}, @samp{force} and
@samp{delay-force} are supported in some implementations:



@itemize @bullet

@item
Calling @samp{force} on an object that is not a promise may simply
return the object.

@item
It may be the case that there is no means by which a promise can be
operationally distinguished from its forced value.  That is, expressions
like the following may evaluate to either @t{#t} or to @t{#f},
depending on the implementation:


@format
@t{(eqv? (delay 1) 1)                ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(pair? (delay (cons 1 2)))        ==>  @emph{unspecified}
}
@end format


@item
Implementations may implement ``implicit forcing,'' where
the value of a promise is forced by procedures
that operate only on arguments of a certain type, like @samp{cdr}
and @samp{*}.  However, procedures that operate uniformly on their
arguments, like @samp{list}, must not force them.


@format
@t{(+ (delay (* 3 7)) 13)            ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(car
  (list (delay (* 3 7)) 13))      ==> @i{}a promise
}
@end format


@end itemize

@end deffn


@deffn {lazy library procedure} promise?  @var{obj}

The @samp{promise?} procedure returns 
@t{#t} if its argument is a promise, and @t{#f} otherwise.  Note
that promises are not necessarily disjoint from other Scheme types such
as procedures.

@end deffn


@deffn {lazy library procedure} make-promise  @var{obj}

The @samp{make-promise} procedure returns a promise which, when forced, will return
@var{obj}.  It is similar to @samp{delay}, but does not delay
its argument: it is a procedure rather than syntax.
If @var{obj} is already a promise, it is returned.

@node Dynamic bindings, Exception handling, Delayed evaluation, Derived expression types
@subsection Dynamic bindings

@cindex @w{dynamic bindings}

The @dfn{dynamic extent} of a procedure call is the time between
@cindex @w{dynamic extent}
when it is initiated and when it returns.  In Scheme, @samp{call-with-current-continuation} (section @pxref{Control features}) allows
reentering a dynamic extent after its procedure call has returned.
Thus, the dynamic extent of a call might not be a single, continuous time
period.

This sections introduces @dfn{parameter objects}, which can be
@cindex @w{parameter objects}
bound to new values for the duration of a dynamic extent.  The set of
all parameter bindings at a given time is called the @dfn{dynamic
  environment}.
@cindex @w{dynamic
  environment}


@deffn {procedure} make-parameter  init
@deffnx {procedure} make-parameter  init converter

Returns a newly allocated parameter object,
which is a procedure that accepts zero arguments and
returns the value associated with the parameter object.
Initially, this value is the value of
@samp{(@var{converter} @var{init})}, or of @var{init}
if the conversion procedure @var{converter} is not specified.
The associated value can be temporarily changed
using @samp{parameterize}, which is described below.

The effect of passing arguments to a parameter object is
implementation-dependent.
@end deffn


@deffn {syntax} (parameterize ((@r{<param1>} @r{<value1>}) @dots{})

@t{hspace*1em@r{<body>})}

@cindex @w{parameterize}

@emph{Syntax:}
Both @r{<param1>} and @r{<value1>} are expressions.

It is an error if the value of any @r{<param>} expression is not a parameter object.
@emph{Semantics:}
A @samp{parameterize} expression is used to change the values returned by
specified parameter objects during the evaluation of the body.

The @r{<param>} and @r{<value>} expressions
are evaluated in an unspecified order.  The @r{<body>} is
evaluated in a dynamic environment in which calls to the
parameters return the results of passing the corresponding values
to the conversion procedure specified when the parameters were created.
Then the previous values of the parameters are restored without passing
them to the conversion procedure.
The results of the last
expression in the @r{<body>} are returned as the results of the entire
@samp{parameterize} expression.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
If the conversion procedure is not idempotent, the results of
@samp{(parameterize ((x (x))) ...)},
which appears to bind the parameter @var{x} to its current value,
might not be what the user expects.
@end quotation


If an implementation supports multiple threads of execution, then
@samp{parameterize} must not change the associated values of any parameters
in any thread other than the current thread and threads created
inside @r{<body>}.

Parameter objects can be used to specify configurable settings for a
computation without the need to pass the value to every
procedure in the call chain explicitly.

@emph{Syntax:}
Each @r{<cond clause>} is as in the specification of @samp{cond}.

that binding, evaluates the clauses as if they were the clauses of a

continuation and dynamic environment of the @samp{guard} expression. If every
@r{<cond clause>}'s @r{<test>} evaluates to @t{#f} and there
is no else clause, then
@samp{raise-continuable} is invoked on the raised object within the dynamic
environment of the original call to @samp{raise}

@deffnx {auxiliary syntax} unquote-splicing


@deffnx {auxiliary syntax} @t{,@@}


``Quasiquote'' expressions are useful
@cindex @w{backquote}
for constructing a list or vector structure when some but not all of the
desired structure is known in advance.  If no
commas appear within the @r{<qq template>}, the result of
@cindex @w{comma}
evaluating
@t{`}@r{<qq template>} is equivalent to the result of evaluating
@t{'}@r{<qq template>}.  If a comma appears within the
@cindex @w{,}
@r{<qq template>}, however, the expression following the comma is
evaluated (``unquoted'') and its result is inserted into the structure
instead of the comma and the expression.  If a comma appears followed
without intervening whitespace by a commercial at-sign (@@), then it is an error if the following
@cindex @w{,@@}
expression does not evaluate to a list; the opening and closing parentheses
of the list are then ``stripped away'' and the elements of the list are
inserted in place of the comma at-sign expression sequence.  A comma
at-sign normally appears only within a list or vector @r{<qq template>}.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
In order to unquote an identifier beginning with @samp{@@}, it is necessary
to use either an explicit @samp{unquote} or to put whitespace after the comma,
to avoid colliding with the comma at-sign sequence.
@end quotation



@format

Quasiquote expressions can be nested.  Substitutions are made only for
unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level
as the outermost quasiquote.  The nesting level increases by one inside
each successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each
unquotation.


@format
@t{`(a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo ,(+ 1 3) d) e) f)

  `(a `(b ,,name1 ,',name2 d) e))           
          ==>  (a `(b ,x ,'y d) e)
}
@end format


A quasiquote expression may return either newly allocated, mutable objects or
literal structure for any structure that is constructed at run time
during the evaluation of the expression. Portions that do not need to
be rebuilt are always literal. Thus,


@format
@t{(let ((a 3)) `((1 2) ,a ,4 ,'five 6))
}
@end format


may be treated as equivalent to either of the following expressions:


@format
@t{`((1 2) 3 4 five 6)

(let ((a 3))
  (cons '(1 2)
        (cons a (cons 4 (cons 'five '(6))))))
}
@end format


However, it is not equivalent to this expression:


@format
@t{(let ((a 3)) (list (list 1 2) a 4 'five 6))
}
@end format


The two notations
 @t{`}@r{<qq template>} and @t{(quasiquote @r{<qq template>})}
 are identical in all respects.
 @samp{,@r{<expression>}} is identical to @samp{(unquote @r{<expression>})},
 and
 @samp{,@@@r{<expression>}} is identical to @samp{(unquote-splicing @r{<expression>})}.
The @code{write} procedure may output either format.
@vindex @w{write}

@cindex @w{`}

          ==>  `(list ,(+ 1 2) 4)
     @emph{}i.e., (quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))

@cindex @w{macros}


Scheme programs can define and use new derived expression types,
 called @emph{macros}.
@cindex @w{macro}
Program-defined expression types have the syntax

@example

(@r{<keyword>} @r{<datum>} ...)

@end example

where @r{<keyword>} is an identifier that uniquely determines the
expression type.  This identifier is called the @emph{syntactic
keyword}, or simply @emph{keyword}, of the macro.  The
@cindex @w{macro keyword}
@cindex @w{keyword}
@cindex @w{syntactic keyword}
number of the @r{<datum>}s, and their syntax, depends on the
expression type.

Each instance of a macro is called a @emph{use}
@cindex @w{macro use}
of the macro.
The set of rules that specifies
how a use of a macro is transcribed into a more primitive expression
is called the @emph{transformer}
@cindex @w{macro transformer}
of the macro.

The macro definition facility consists of two parts:



@itemize @bullet

@item
A set of expressions used to establish that certain identifiers
are macro keywords, associate them with macro transformers, and control
the scope within which a macro is defined, and

@item
a pattern language for specifying macro transformers.

@end itemize


The syntactic keyword of a macro can shadow variable bindings, and local
variable bindings can shadow syntactic bindings.    
Two mechanisms are provided to prevent unintended conflicts:



@itemize @bullet


@item
If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier
(variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be renamed
throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.
Note that a global variable definition may or may not introduce a binding;
see section @ref{Variable definitions}.

@item
If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an
identifier, the reference refers to the binding that was visible
where the transformer was specified, regardless of any local
bindings that surround the use of the macro.


@end itemize


In consequence, all macros
defined using the pattern language  are ``hygienic'' and ``referentially
transparent'' and thus preserve Scheme's lexical scoping. [Kohlbecker86], [
hygienic], [Bawden88], [macrosthatwork], [syntacticabstraction]

@cindex @w{referentially transparent}
@cindex @w{hygienic}

Implementations may provide macro facilities of other types.

@node Binding constructs for syntactic keywords, Pattern language, Macros, Macros
@subsection Binding constructs for syntactic keywords

@cindex @w{binding constructs for syntactic keywords}


The @samp{let-syntax} and @samp{letrec-syntax} binding constructs are
analogous to @samp{let} and @samp{letrec}, but they bind
syntactic keywords to macro transformers instead of binding variables
to locations that contain values.  Syntactic keywords can also be
bound globally or locally with @samp{define-syntax};
see section @ref{Syntax definitions}.


@deffn {syntax} let-syntax  @r{<bindings>} @r{<body>}

@r{<Bindings>} has the form

Each @r{<keyword>} is an identifier,
each @r{<transformer spec>} is an instance of @samp{syntax-rules}, and
@r{<body>} is a sequence of zero or more definitions followed
by one or more expressions.  It is an error
for a @r{<keyword>} to appear more than once in the list of keywords
being bound.

@emph{Semantics:}
The @r{<body>} is expanded in the syntactic environment
obtained by extending the syntactic environment of the
@samp{let-syntax} expression with macros whose keywords are
the @r{<keyword>}s, bound to the specified transformers.
Each binding of a @r{<keyword>} has @r{<body>} as its region.

Each binding of a @r{<keyword>} has the @r{<transformer spec>}s

@t{(@r{<element>} @dots{})
(@r{<element>} @r{<element>} @dots{} . @r{<template>})
(@r{<ellipsis>} @r{<template>})
#(@r{<element>} @dots{})
}
@end format

where an @r{<element>} is a @r{<template>} optionally
followed by an @r{<ellipsis>}.
An @r{<ellipsis>} is the identifier specified in the second form
of @samp{syntax-rules}, or the default identifier @samp{...}
(three consecutive periods) otherwise.
@vindex ...

@emph{Semantics:} An instance of @samp{syntax-rules} produces a new macro
transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A use
of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by
@samp{syntax-rules} is matched against the patterns contained in the
@r{<syntax rule>}s, beginning with the leftmost @r{<syntax rule>}.
When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically
according to the template.

An identifier appearing within a @r{<pattern>} can be an underscore
(@samp{ }), a literal identifier listed in the list of @r{<pattern literal>}s,
or the @r{<ellipsis>}.
All other identifiers appearing within a @r{<pattern>} are
@emph{pattern variables}.

The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a
@r{<syntax rule>} is not involved in the matching and
is considered neither a pattern variable nor a literal identifier.

Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and
are used to refer to elements of the input in the template.
It is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a
@r{<pattern>}.

Underscores also match arbitrary input elements but are not pattern variables
and so cannot be used to refer to those elements.  If an underscore appears
in the @r{<pattern literal>}s list, then that takes precedence and
underscores in the @r{<pattern>} match as literals.
Multiple underscores can appear in a @r{<pattern>}.

Identifiers that appear in @t{(@r{<pattern literal>} @dots{})} are
interpreted as literal
identifiers to be matched against corresponding elements of the input.
An element in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an
identifier and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its
occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or
the two identifiers are the same and both have no lexical binding.

A subpattern followed by @r{<ellipsis>} can match zero or more elements of
the input, unless @r{<ellipsis>} appears in the @r{<pattern literal>}s, in which
case it is matched as a literal.

More formally, an input expression E matches a pattern P if and only if:



@itemize @bullet

@item
P is an underscore (@samp{ }).

@item
P is a non-literal identifier; or

@item
P is a literal identifier and E is an identifier with the same
binding; or

@item
P is a list @samp{(P_1 @dots{} P_n)} and E is a
list of n
elements that match P_1 through P_n, respectively; or

@item
P is an improper list
@samp{(P_1 P_2 @dots{} P_n . P_n+1)}
and E is a list or
improper list of n or more elements that match P_1 through P_n,
respectively, and whose nth tail matches P_n+1; or

@item
P is of the form
@samp{(P_1 @dots{} P_k P_e <ellipsis> P_m+1 @dots{} P_n)}
where E is
a proper list of n elements, the first k of which match
P_1 through P_k, respectively,
whose next m-k elements each match P_e,
whose remaining n-m elements match P_m+1 through P_n; or

@item
P is of the form
@samp{(P_1 @dots{} P_k P_e <ellipsis> P_m+1 @dots{} P_n . P_x)}
where E is
a list or improper list of n elements, the first k of which match
P_1 through P_k,
whose next m-k elements each match P_e,
whose remaining n-m elements match P_m+1 through P_n,
and whose nth and final cdr matches P_x; or

@item
P is a vector of the form @samp{#(P_1 @dots{} P_n)}
and E is a vector
of n elements that match P_1 through P_n; or

@item
P is of the form
@samp{#(P_1 @dots{} P_k P_e <ellipsis> P_m+1 @dots{} P_n)}
where E is a vector of n
elements the first k of which match P_1 through P_k,
whose next m-k elements each match P_e,
and whose remaining n-m elements match P_m+1 through P_n; or

@item
P is a constant and E is equal to P in the sense of
the @samp{equal?} procedure.

@end itemize


It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its
binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.

When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching @r{<syntax rule>}, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the elements they match in the input.
Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more
instances of the identifier
@r{<ellipsis>} are allowed only in subtemplates that are
followed by as many instances of @r{<ellipsis>}.
They are replaced in the
output by all of the elements they match in the input, distributed as
indicated.  It is an error if the output cannot be built up as
specified.

@c %% This description of output construction is very vague.  It should
@c %% probably be formalized, but that is not easy...

Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern variables
or the identifier
@r{<ellipsis>} are inserted into the output as literal identifiers.  If a
literal identifier is inserted as a free identifier then it refers to the
binding of that identifier within whose scope the instance of
@samp{syntax-rules} appears.
If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is
in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.

A template of the form
@samp{(@r{<ellipsis>} @r{<template>})} is identical to @r{<template>},
except that
ellipses within the template have no special meaning.
That is, any ellipses contained within @r{<template>} are
treated as ordinary identifiers.
In particular, the template @samp{(@r{<ellipsis>} @r{<ellipsis>})} produces
a single @r{<ellipsis>}.
This allows syntactic abstractions to expand into code containing
ellipses.

As an example, if @code{let} and @code{cond} are defined as in
@vindex @w{cond}
@vindex @w{let}
section @ref{Derived expression type} then they are hygienic (as required) and
the following is not an error.


@format
@t{(let ((=> #f))
  (cond (#t => 'ok)))                  ==> ok
}
@end format


The macro transformer for @samp{cond} recognizes @samp{=>}
as a local variable, and hence an expression, and not as the
base identifier @samp{=>}, which the macro transformer treats
as a syntactic keyword.  Thus the example expands into


@format
@t{(let ((=> #f))
  (if #t (begin => 'ok)))
}
@end format


instead of


@format
@t{(let ((=> #f))
  (let ((temp #t))
    (if temp ('ok temp))))
}

which would result in an invalid procedure call.

@node Programs, Import declarations, Program structure, Program structure
@section Programs

@cindex @w{programs}

A Scheme program consists of  
one or more import declarations followed by a sequence of
expressions and definitions.
Import declarations specify the libraries on which a program or library depends;
a subset of the identifiers exported by the libraries are made available to
the program.
Expressions are described in chapter @ref{Expressions}.
Definitions are either variable definitions, syntax definitions, or
record-type definitions, all of which are explained in this chapter.
They are valid in some, but not all, contexts where expressions
are allowed, specifically at the outermost level of a @r{<program>}
and at the beginning of a @r{<body>}.

@cindex @w{definition}

At the outermost level of a program, @t{(begin @r{<expression or definition1>} @dots{})} is
equivalent to the sequence of expressions and definitions
in the @code{begin}.   
@vindex @w{begin}
Similarly, in a @r{<body>}, @t{(begin @r{<definition1>} @dots{})} is equivalent
to the sequence @r{<definition1>} @dots{}.
Macros can expand into such @samp{begin} forms.
For the formal definition, see @ref{Sequencing}.

Import declarations and definitions
cause bindings to be created in the global
environment or modify the value of existing global bindings.
The initial environment of a program is empty,
so at least one import declaration is needed to introduce initial bindings.

Expressions occurring at the outermost level of a program
do not create any bindings.  They are
executed in order when the program is
invoked or loaded, and typically perform some kind of initialization.


Programs and libraries are typically stored in files, although
in some implementations they can be entered interactively into a running
Scheme system.  Other paradigms are possible.
Implementations which store libraries in files should document the
mapping from the name of a library to its location in the file system.

@node Import declarations, Variable definitions, Programs, Program structure
@section Import declarations

@cindex @w{import declarations}

@cindex @w{import}

An import declaration takes the following form:

@example

(import @r{<import-set>} @dots{})

@end example


An import declaration provides a way to import identifiers
exported by a library.  Each @r{<import set>} names a set of bindings
from a library and possibly specifies local names for the
imported bindings. It takes one of the following forms:



@itemize @bullet

@item
@t{@r{<library name>}}
@item
@t{(only @r{<import set>} @r{<identifier>} @dots{})}
@item
@t{(except @r{<import set>} @r{<identifier>} @dots{})}
@item
@t{(prefix @r{<import set>} @r{<identifier>})}
@item
@t{(rename @r{<import set>}
@item hspace*4em(@r{<identifier1>} @r{<identifier2>}) @dots{})}

@end itemize


In the first form, all of the identifiers in the named library's export
clauses are imported with the same names (or the exported names if
exported with @code{rename}).  The additional @r{<import set>}
@vindex @w{rename}
forms modify this set as follows:



@itemize @bullet


@item
@code{only} produces a subset of the given
@r{<import set>} including only the listed identifiers (after any
renaming).  It is an error if any of the listed identifiers are
not found in the original set.

@item
@code{except} produces a subset of the given
@r{<import set>}, excluding the listed identifiers (after any
renaming). It is an error if any of the listed identifiers are not
found in the original set.

@item
@code{rename} modifies the given @r{<import set>},
replacing each instance of @r{<identifier1>} with
@r{<identifier2>}. It is an error if any of the listed
@r{<identifier1>}s are not found in the original set.

@item
@code{prefix} automatically renames all identifiers in
the given @r{<import set>}, prefixing each with the specified
@r{<identifier>}.


@end itemize

@vindex @w{prefix}
@vindex @w{except}
@vindex @w{only}

In a program or library declaration, it is an error to import the same
identifier more than once with different bindings, or to redefine or
mutate an imported binding with a definition
or with @samp{set!}, or to refer to an identifier before it is imported.
However, a REPL should permit these actions.

@end menu

@cindex @w{variable definitions}


@cindex @w{variable definition}

A variable definition binds one or more identifiers and specifies an initial
value for each of them.
The simplest kind of variable definition
takes one of the following forms:
@cindex @w{define}



@itemize @bullet


@item @t{(define @r{<variable>} @r{<expression>})}

@item @t{(define (@r{<variable>} @r{<formals>}) @r{<body>})}

@r{<Formals>} are either a
sequence of zero or more variables, or a sequence of one or more
variables followed by a space-delimited period and another variable (as
in a lambda expression).  This form is equivalent to

@example

(define @r{<variable>}
  (lambda (@r{<formals>}) @r{<body>}))@r{.}

@end example


@item @t{(define (@r{<variable>} .@: @r{<formal>}) @r{<body>})}

@r{<Formal>} is a single
variable.  This form is equivalent to

@example

(define @r{<variable>}
  (lambda @r{<formal>} @r{<body>}))@r{.}

@end example



@end itemize


@node Top level definitions, Internal definitions, Variable definitions, Variable definitions
@subsection Top level definitions

@cindex @w{top level definitions}

At the outermost level of a program, a definition

@example

(define @r{<variable>} @r{<expression>})

@end example

has essentially the same effect as the assignment expression

@example

(set! @r{<variable>} @r{<expression>})

@end example

if @r{<variable>} is bound to a non-syntax value.  However, if
@r{<variable>} is not bound, 
or is a syntactic keyword,
then the definition will bind
@r{<variable>} to a new location before performing the assignment,
whereas it would be an error to perform a @samp{set!} on an
unbound variable.
@cindex @w{unbound}


@example

(define add3
  (lambda (x) (+ x 3)))
(add3 3)                               ==>  6
(define first car)
(first '(1 2))                         ==>  1

@end example


@node Internal definitions, Multiple-value definitions, Top level definitions, Variable definitions
@subsection Internal definitions

@cindex @w{internal definitions}


Definitions can occur at the
beginning of a @r{<body>} (that is, the body of a @code{lambda},
@vindex @w{lambda}
@code{let}, @code{let*}, @code{letrec}, @code{letrec*},
@vindex @w{letrec*}
@vindex @w{letrec}
@vindex @w{let*}
@vindex @w{let}
@code{let-values}, @code{let*-values}, @code{let-syntax}, @code{letrec-syntax},
@vindex @w{letrec-syntax}
@vindex @w{let-syntax}
@vindex @w{let*-values}
@vindex @w{let-values}
@code{parameterize}, @code{guard}, or @code{case-lambda}).  Note that
@vindex @w{case-lambda}
@vindex @w{guard}
@vindex @w{parameterize}
such a body might not be apparent until after expansion of other syntax.
Such definitions are known as @emph{internal definitions} as opposed to the global definitions described above.
@cindex @w{internal definition}
The variables defined by internal definitions are local to the
@r{<body>}.  That is, @r{<variable>} is bound rather than assigned,
and the region of the binding is the entire @r{<body>}.  For example,


@example

(let ((x 5))
  (define foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
  (define bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a)))
  (foo (+ x 3)))                       ==>  45

@end example


An expanded @r{<body>} containing internal definitions
can always be
converted into a completely equivalent @samp{letrec*} expression.  For
example, the @samp{let} expression in the above example is equivalent
to


@example

(let ((x 5))
  (letrec* ((foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
            (bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a))))
    (foo (+ x 3))))

@end example


Just as for the equivalent @samp{letrec*} expression, it is an error if it is not
possible to evaluate each @r{<expression>} of every internal
definition in a @r{<body>} without assigning or referring to
the value of the corresponding @r{<variable>} or the @r{<variable>}
of any of the definitions that follow it in @r{<body>}.

It is an error to define the same identifier more than once in the
same @r{<body>}.

Wherever an internal definition can occur,
@t{(begin @r{<definition1>} @dots{})}
is equivalent to the sequence of definitions
that form the body of the @code{begin}.
@vindex @w{begin}

@node Multiple-value definitions,  , Internal definitions, Variable definitions
@subsection Multiple-value definitions

@cindex @w{multiple-value definitions}

Another kind of definition is provided by @samp{define-values}, 
which creates multiple definitions from a single
expression returning multiple values.
It is allowed wherever @samp{define} is allowed.


@deffn {syntax} define-values  @r{<formals>} @r{<expression>}

It is an error if a variable appears more than once in the set of @r{<formals>}.

@emph{Semantics:}
@r{<Expression>} is evaluated, and the @r{<formals>} are bound
to the return values in the same way that the @r{<formals>} in a
@samp{lambda} expression are matched to the arguments in a procedure
call.


@format
@t{(define-values (x y) (exact-integer-sqrt 17))

@end deffn

@node Syntax definitions, Record-type definitions, Variable definitions, Program structure

@cindex @w{syntax definitions}


@cindex @w{syntax definition}
Syntax definitions have this form:
@cindex @w{define-syntax}

@t{(define-syntax @r{<keyword>} @r{<transformer spec>})}

@r{<Keyword>} is an identifier, and
the @r{<transformer spec>} is an instance of @code{syntax-rules}.
@vindex @w{syntax-rules}
Like variable definitions, syntax definitions can appear at the outermost level or
nested within a @code{body}.
@vindex @w{body}

If the @samp{define-syntax} occurs at the outermost level, then the global
syntactic environment is extended by binding the
@r{<keyword>} to the specified transformer, but previous expansions
of any global binding for @r{<keyword>} remain unchanged.
Otherwise, it is an @dfn{internal syntax definition}, and is local to the
@cindex @w{internal syntax definition}
@r{<body>} in which it is defined.
Any use of a syntax keyword before its corresponding definition is an error.
In particular, a use that precedes an inner definition will not apply an outer
definition.


@example

(let ((x 1) (y 2))
  (define-syntax swap!
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((swap! a b)
       (let ((tmp a))
         (set! a b)
         (set! b tmp)))))

Macros can expand into definitions in any context that permits
them. However, it is an error for a definition to define an
identifier whose binding has to be known in order to determine the meaning of the
definition itself, or of any preceding definition that belongs to the
same group of internal definitions. Similarly, it is an error for an
internal definition to define an identifier whose binding has to be known
in order
to determine the boundary between the internal definitions and the
expressions of the body it belongs to. For example, the following are
errors:


@example

(define define 3)

(begin (define begin list))

(let-syntax
    ((foo (syntax-rules ()
            ((foo (proc args ...) body ...)

@dfn{Record-type definitions} are used to introduce new data types, called

}
@end format

or of the form

@format
@t{(@r{<field name>} @r{<accessor name>} @r{<modifier name>})

@end format


It is an error for the same identifier to occur more than once as a
field name.
It is also an error for the same identifier to occur more than once
as an accessor or mutator name.

The @samp{define-record-type} construct is generative: each use creates a new record
type that is distinct from all existing types, including Scheme's
predefined types and other record types --- even record types of
the same name or structure.

An instance of @samp{define-record-type} is equivalent to the following
definitions:



@itemize @bullet


@item
@r{<name>} is bound to a representation of the record type itself.
This may be a run-time object or a purely syntactic representation.
The representation is not utilized in this report, but it serves as a
means to identify the record type for use by further language extensions.

@item
@r{<constructor name>} is bound to a procedure that takes as
many arguments as there are @r{<field name>}s in the
@t{(@r{<constructor name>} @dots{})} subexpression and returns a
new record of type @r{<name>}.  Fields whose names are listed with
@r{<constructor name>} have the corresponding argument as their
initial value.  The initial values of all other fields are
unspecified.  It is an error for a field name to appear in
@r{<constructor>} but not as a @r{<field name>}.

@item
@r{<pred>} is bound to a predicate that returns @t{#t} when given a
value returned by the procedure bound to  @r{<constructor name>} and @t{#f} for
everything else.

@item
Each @r{<accessor name>} is bound to a procedure that takes a record of
type @r{<name>} and returns the current value of the corresponding
field.  It is an error to pass an accessor a value which is not a
record of the appropriate type.

@item
Each @r{<modifier name>} is bound to a procedure that takes a record of
type @r{<name>} and a value which becomes the new value of the
corresponding field; an unspecified value is returned.  It is an
error to pass a modifier a first argument which is not a record of
the appropriate type.


@end itemize

@format
@t{(define-record-type <pare>
  (kons x y)
  pare?
  (x kar set-kar!)
  (y kdr))

@subsection Library Syntax

@cindex @w{library syntax}

A library definition takes the following form:

@cindex @w{define-library}


@example

(define-library @r{<library name>}
  @r{<library declaration>} @dots{})

@end example


@r{<library name>} is a list whose members are identifiers and exact non-negative integers.  It is used to
identify the library uniquely when importing from other programs or
libraries.
Libraries whose first identifier is @samp{scheme} are reserved for use by this
report and future versions of this report.
Libraries whose first identifier is @samp{srfi} are reserved for libraries
implementing Scheme Requests for Implementation.
It is inadvisable, but not an error, for identifiers in library names to
contain any of the characters @samp{| \? * < " : > + [ ] /}
or control characters after escapes are expanded.


A @r{<library declaration>} is any of:



@itemize @bullet


@item @t{(export @r{<export spec>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(import @r{<import set>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(begin @r{<command or definition>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(include @r{<filename1>} @r{<filename2>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(include-ci @r{<filename1>} @r{<filename2>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(include-library-declarations @r{<filename1>} @r{<filename2>} @dots{})}

@item @t{(cond-expand @r{<ce-clause1>} @r{<ce-clause2>} @dots{})}


@end itemize


An @code{export} declaration specifies a list of identifiers which
@vindex @w{export}
can be made visible to other libraries or programs.
An @r{<export spec>} takes one of the following forms:



@itemize @bullet

@item @r{<identifier>}
@item @t{(rename @r{<identifier1>} @r{<identifier2>})}

@end itemize


In an @r{<export spec>}, an @r{<identifier>} names a single
binding defined within or imported into the library, where the
external name for the export is the same as the name of the binding
within the library. A @code{rename} spec exports the binding 
@vindex @w{rename}
defined within or imported into the library and named by
@r{<identifier1>} in each
@t{(@r{<identifier1>} @r{<identifier2>})} pairing,
using @r{<identifier2>} as the external name.

An @code{import} declaration provides a way to import the identifiers
@vindex @w{import}
exported by another library.  It has the same syntax and semantics as
an import declaration used in a program or at the REPL (see section @pxref{import}).

The @code{begin}, @code{include}, and @code{include-ci} declarations are
@vindex @w{include-ci}
@vindex @w{include}
@vindex @w{begin}
used to specify the body of
the library.  They have the same syntax and semantics as the corresponding
expression types.
This form of @samp{begin} is analogous to, but not the same as, the
two types of @samp{begin} defined in section @ref{Sequencing}.

The @code{include-library-declarations} declaration is similar to
@vindex @w{include-library-declarations}
@code{include} except that the contents of the file are spliced directly into the
current library definition.  This can be used, for example, to share the
same @code{export} declaration among multiple libraries as a simple
form of library interface.

The @code{cond-expand} declaration has the same syntax and semantics as
@vindex @w{cond-expand}
the @code{cond-expand} expression type, except that it expands to
spliced-in library declarations rather than expressions enclosed in @samp{begin}.

@ignore todo
Shinn: Perhaps make this a separate subsection describing a
  library ``resolution'' phase which runs prior to library expansion.
@end ignore


One possible implementation of libraries is as follows:
After all @code{cond-expand} library declarations are expanded, a new
environment is constructed for the library consisting of all
imported bindings.  The expressions
from all @code{begin}, @code{include} and @code{include-ci}
library declarations are expanded in that environment in the order in which
they occur in the library.
Alternatively, @code{cond-expand} and @code{import} declarations may be processed
in left to right order interspersed with the processing of other
declarations, with the environment growing as imported bindings are
added to it by each @code{import} declaration.

When a library is loaded, its expressions are executed
in textual order.
If a library's definitions are referenced in the expanded form of a
program or library body, then that library must be loaded before the
expanded program or library body is evaluated. This rule applies
transitively.  If a library is imported by more than one program or
library, it may possibly be loaded additional times.

Similarly, during the expansion of a library @samp{(foo)}, if any syntax
keywords imported from another library @samp{(bar)} are needed to expand
the library, then the library @samp{(bar)} must be expanded and its syntax
definitions evaluated before the expansion of @samp{(foo)}.

Regardless of the number of times that a library is loaded, each
program or library that imports bindings from a library must do so from a
single loading of that library, regardless of the number of import
declarations in which it appears.
That is, @samp{(import (only (foo) a))} followed by @samp{(import (only (foo) b))}
has the same effect as @samp{(import (only (foo) a b))}.

The following example shows
how a program can be divided into libraries plus a relatively small
main program [life].
If the main program is entered into a REPL, it is not necessary to import
the base library.

@section The REPL

@cindex @w{the repl}

Implementations may provide an interactive session called a
@dfn{REPL} (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where import declarations,
@cindex @w{repl}
expressions and definitions can be
entered and evaluated one at a time.  For convenience and ease of use,
the global Scheme environment in a REPL
must not be empty, but must start out with at least the bindings provided by the
base library.  This library includes the core syntax of Scheme
and generally useful procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the
variable @samp{abs} is bound to a
procedure of one argument that computes the absolute value of a
number, and the variable @samp{+} is bound to a procedure that computes
sums.  The full list of @samp{(scheme base)} bindings can be found in
Appendix @ref{Standard Libraries}.

Implementations may provide an initial REPL environment 
which behaves as if all possible variables are bound to locations, most of
which contain unspecified values.  Top level REPL definitions in
such an implementation are truly equivalent to assignments,
unless the identifier is defined as a syntax keyword.

An implementation may provide a mode of operation in which the REPL
reads its input from a file.  Such a file is not, in general, the same
as a program, because it can contain import declarations in places other than
the beginning.

This chapter describes Scheme's built-in procedures.  

The procedures @samp{force}, @samp{promise?}, and @samp{make-promise} are intimately associated
with the expression types @samp{delay} and @samp{delay-force}, and are described
with them in section @ref{Delayed evaluation}.  In the same way, the procedure
@samp{make-parameter} is intimately associated with the expression type
@samp{parameterize}, and is described with it in section @ref{Dynamic bindings}.

@end ignore

A program can use a global variable definition to bind any variable.  It may
subsequently alter any such binding by an assignment (see
section @pxref{Assignments}).  These operations do not modify the behavior of
any procedure defined in this report or imported from a library
(see section @pxref{Libraries}).  Altering any global binding that has
not been introduced by a definition has an unspecified effect on the
behavior of the procedures defined in this chapter.

When a procedure is said to return a @dfn{newly allocated} object,
@cindex @w{newly allocated}
it means that the locations in the object are fresh.

@section Equivalence predicates

@cindex @w{equivalence predicates}


A @dfn{predicate} is a procedure that always returns a boolean
@cindex @w{predicate}
value (@t{#t} or @t{#f}).  An @dfn{equivalence predicate} is
@cindex @w{equivalence predicate}
the computational analogue of a mathematical equivalence relation; it is
symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.  Of the equivalence predicates
described in this section, @samp{eq?} is the finest or most
discriminating, @samp{equal?} is the coarsest, and @samp{eqv?} is
slightly less discriminating than @samp{eq?}.  



@deffn {procedure} eqv?  obj1 obj2

The @samp{eqv?} procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on objects.
Briefly, it returns @t{#t} if @var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are
normally regarded as the same object.  This relation is left slightly
open to interpretation, but the following partial specification of
@samp{eqv?} holds for all implementations of Scheme.

The @samp{eqv?} procedure returns @t{#t} if:



@itemize @bullet

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both @t{#t} or both @t{#f}.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both symbols and are the same
symbol according to the @samp{symbol=?} procedure
(section @pxref{Symbols}).

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both exact numbers and
are numerically equal (in the sense of @samp{=}).

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both inexact numbers such that
they are numerically equal (in the sense of @samp{=})
and they yield the same results (in the sense of @samp{eqv?})
when passed as arguments to any other procedure
that can be defined as a finite composition of Scheme's standard
arithmetic procedures, provided it does not result in a NaN value.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both characters and are the same
character according to the @samp{char=?} procedure
(section @pxref{Characters}).

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both the empty list.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are pairs, vectors, bytevectors, records,
or strings that denote the same location in the store
(section @pxref{Storage model}).

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are procedures whose location tags are
equal (section @pxref{Procedures}).

@end itemize


The @samp{eqv?} procedure returns @t{#f} if:



@itemize @bullet

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are of different types
(section @pxref{Disjointness of types}).

@item
one of @var{obj1} and @var{obj2} is @t{#t} but the other is
@t{#f}.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are symbols but are not the same
symbol according to the @samp{symbol=?} procedure
(section @pxref{Symbols}).

@item
one of @var{obj1} and @var{obj2} is an exact number but the other
is an inexact number.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both exact numbers and
are numerically unequal (in the sense of @samp{=}).

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are both inexact numbers such that either
they are numerically unequal (in the sense of @samp{=}),
or they do not yield the same results (in the sense of @samp{eqv?})
when passed as arguments to any other procedure
that can be defined as a finite composition of Scheme's standard
arithmetic procedures, provided it does not result in a NaN value.
As an exception, the behavior of @samp{eqv?} is unspecified
when both @var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are NaN.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are characters for which the @samp{char=?}
procedure returns @t{#f}.

@item
one of @var{obj1} and @var{obj2} is the empty list but the other
is not.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are pairs, vectors, bytevectors, records,
or strings that denote distinct locations.

@item
@var{obj1} and @var{obj2} are procedures that would behave differently
(return different values or have different side effects) for some arguments.

}
@end format


The following examples illustrate cases in which the above rules do
not fully specify the behavior of @samp{eqv?}.  All that can be said
about such cases is that the value returned by @samp{eqv?} must be a
boolean.


@format
@t{(eqv? "" "")                           ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? '#() '#())                       ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (x) x))                  ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (y) y))                  ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? 1.0e0 1.0f0)                     ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? +nan.0 +nan.0)                   ==>  @emph{unspecified}
}
@end format


Note that @samp{(eqv? 0.0 -0.0)} will return @t{#f} if negative zero
is distinguished, and @t{#t} if negative zero is not distinguished.

The next set of examples shows the use of @samp{eqv?} with procedures
that have local state.  The @samp{gen-counter} procedure must return a distinct
procedure every time, since each procedure has its own internal counter.
The @samp{gen-loser} procedure, however, returns operationally equivalent procedures each time, since
the local state does not affect the value or side effects of the
procedures.  However, @samp{eqv?} may or may not detect this equivalence.


@format
@t{(define gen-counter
  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n))))
(let ((g (gen-counter)))
  (eqv? g g))                          ==>  #t
(eqv? (gen-counter) (gen-counter))
                                       ==>  #f
(define gen-loser
  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))
(let ((g (gen-loser)))
  (eqv? g g))                          ==>  #t
(eqv? (gen-loser) (gen-loser))
                                       ==>  @emph{unspecified}

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'f)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'g))))
  (eqv? f g))
                                       ==>  @emph{unspecified}

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'f 'both)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'g 'both))))
  (eqv? f g))
                                       ==>  #f
}
@end format


Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those returned by
literal expressions), implementations may
share structure between constants where appropriate.  Thus
the value of @samp{eqv?} on constants is sometimes
implementation-dependent.


@format
@t{(eqv? '(a) '(a))                       ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? "a" "a")                         ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(eqv? '(b) (cdr '(a b)))               ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(let ((x '(a)))
  (eqv? x x))                          ==>  #t
}
@end format


The above definition of @samp{eqv?} allows implementations latitude in
their treatment of procedures and literals:  implementations may
either detect or fail to detect that two procedures or two literals
are equivalent to each other, and can decide whether or not to
merge representations of equivalent objects by using the same pointer or
bit pattern to represent both.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
If inexact numbers are represented as IEEE binary floating-point numbers,
then an implementation of @samp{eqv?} that simply compares equal-sized
inexact numbers for bitwise equality is correct by the above definition.
@end quotation


@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} eq?  obj1 obj2

The @samp{eq?} procedure is similar to @samp{eqv?} except that in some cases it is
capable of discerning distinctions finer than those detectable by
@samp{eqv?}.  It must always return @t{#f} when @samp{eqv?} also
would, but may return @t{#f} in some cases where @samp{eqv?} would return @t{#t}.

On symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, and records,
and also on non-empty
strings, vectors, and bytevectors, @samp{eq?} and @samp{eqv?} are guaranteed to have the same
behavior.  On procedures, @samp{eq?} must return true if the arguments' location
tags are equal.  On numbers and characters, @samp{eq?}'s behavior is
implementation-dependent, but it will always return either true or
false.  On empty strings, empty vectors, and empty bytevectors, @samp{eq?} may also behave
differently from @samp{eqv?}.

}
@end format




@quotation
@emph{Rationale:} It will usually be possible to implement @samp{eq?} much
more efficiently than @samp{eqv?}, for example, as a simple pointer
comparison instead of as some more complicated operation.  One reason is
that it is not always possible to compute @samp{eqv?} of two numbers in
constant time, whereas @samp{eq?} implemented as pointer comparison will
always finish in constant time.

@deffn {procedure} equal?  obj1 obj2

The @samp{equal?} procedure, when applied to pairs, vectors, strings and
bytevectors, recursively compares them, returning @t{#t} when the
unfoldings of its arguments into (possibly infinite) trees are equal
(in the sense of @samp{equal?})
as ordered trees, and @t{#f} otherwise.  It returns the same as
@samp{eqv?} when applied to booleans, symbols, numbers, characters,
ports, procedures, and the empty list.  If two objects are @samp{eqv?},
they must be @samp{equal?} as well.  In all other cases, @samp{equal?}
may return either @t{#t} or @t{#f}.
@c % Note that records are {\cf equal?} if their record types are the same
@c % and their correspondingly named fields are {\cf equal?}.

Even if its arguments are
circular data structures, @samp{equal?} must always terminate.

It is important to distinguish between mathematical numbers, the
Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations
used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
This report uses the types @i{number}, @i{complex}, @i{real},
@i{rational}, and @i{integer} to refer to both mathematical numbers
and Scheme numbers.  

@node Numerical types, Exactness, Numbers, Numbers
@subsection Numerical types

@cindex @w{numerical types}



Mathematically, numbers are arranged into a tower of subtypes
in which each level is a subset of the level above it:

@format
         @r{number} 
          @r{complex number} 
          @r{real number} 
          @r{rational number} 
          @r{integer} 
@end format


For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex number.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers
that model 3.  For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the
predicates @code{number?}, @code{complex?}, @code{real?}, @code{rational?},
@vindex @w{rational?}
@vindex @w{real?}
@vindex @w{complex?}
@vindex @w{number?}
and @code{integer?}.
@vindex @w{integer?}

There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its
representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of
Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these
different representations denote the same integer.

Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as
independent of their representation as possible.  Although an implementation
of Scheme may use multiple internal representations of
numbers, this ought not to be apparent to a casual programmer writing
simple programs.

@node Exactness, Implementation restrictions, Numerical types, Numbers
@subsection Exactness

@cindex @w{exactness}

 

It is useful to distinguish between numbers that are
represented exactly and those that might not be.  For example, indexes
into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial
coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the
results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers
may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.

A Scheme number is
@i{exact} if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from
@r{exact} numbers using only @r{exact} operations.  A number is
@i{inexact} if it was written as an inexact constant,
if it was
derived using @r{inexact} ingredients, or if it was derived using
@r{inexact} operations. Thus @r{inexact}ness is a contagious
property of a number.
In particular, an @dfn{exact complex number} has an exact real part
@cindex @w{exact complex number}
and an exact imaginary part; all other complex numbers are @dfn{inexact
complex numbers}.
@cindex @w{inexact
complex numbers}

If two implementations produce @r{exact} results for a
computation that did not involve @r{inexact} intermediate results,
the two ultimate results will be mathematically equal.  This is
generally not true of computations involving @r{inexact} numbers
since approximate methods such as floating-point arithmetic may be used,
but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as
practical to the mathematically ideal result.

Rational operations such as @samp{+} should always produce
@r{exact} results when given @r{exact} arguments.
If the operation is unable to produce an @r{exact} result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an @r{inexact} value.
However, @samp{(/ 3 4)} must not return the mathematically incorrect value @samp{0}.
See section @ref{Implementation restrictions}.

Except for @code{exact}, the operations described in
@vindex @w{exact}
this section must generally return inexact results when given any inexact
arguments.  An operation may, however, return an @r{exact} result if it can
prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an @r{exact} zero
may produce an @r{exact} zero result, even if the other argument is
@r{inexact}.

Specifically, the expression @samp{(* 0 +inf.0)} may return @samp{0},
or @samp{+nan.0}, or report that inexact numbers are not supported,
or report that non-rational real numbers are not supported, or fail
silently or noisily in other implementation-specific ways.

@node Implementation restrictions, Implementation extensions, Exactness, Numbers
@subsection Implementation restrictions

@cindex @w{implementation restrictions}


@cindex @w{implementation restriction}

Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole
tower of subtypes given in section @ref{Numerical types},
but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the
purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.
For example, implementations in which all numbers are @r{real},
or in which non-@r{real} numbers are always @r{inexact},
or in which @r{exact} numbers are always @r{integer},
are still quite useful.

Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of
any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported
range for @r{exact} numbers of any type may be different from the
supported range for @r{inexact} numbers of that type.  For example,
an implementation that uses IEEE binary double-precision floating-point numbers to represent all its
@r{inexact} @r{real} numbers may also
support a practically unbounded range of @r{exact} @r{integer}s
and @r{rational}s
while limiting the range of @r{inexact} @r{real}s (and therefore
the range of @r{inexact} @r{integer}s and @r{rational}s)
to the dynamic range of the IEEE binary double format.
Furthermore,
the gaps between the representable @r{inexact} @r{integer}s and
@r{rational}s are
likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this
range are approached.

An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
throughout the range of numbers permitted as indexes of
lists, vectors, bytevectors, and strings or that result from computing the length of
one of these.  The @code{length}, @code{vector-length},
@vindex @w{vector-length}
@vindex @w{length}
@code{bytevector-length}, and @code{string-length} procedures must return an exact
@vindex @w{string-length}
@vindex @w{bytevector-length}
integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an
index.  Furthermore, any integer constant within the index range, if
expressed by an exact integer syntax, must be read as an exact
integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that apply
outside this range.  Finally, the procedures listed below will always
return exact integer results provided all their arguments are exact integers
and the mathematically expected results are representable as exact integers
within the implementation:


@example

-                     *
+                     abs
ceiling               denominator
exact-integer-sqrt    expt
floor                 floor/
floor-quotient        floor-remainder
gcd                   lcm
max                   min
modulo                numerator
quotient              rationalize
remainder             round
square                truncate
truncate/             truncate-quotient
truncate-remainder

@end example


It is recommended, but not required, that implementations support
@r{exact} @r{integer}s and @r{exact} @r{rational}s of
practically unlimited size and precision, and to implement the
above procedures and the @samp{/} procedure in
such a way that they always return @r{exact} results when given @r{exact}
arguments.  If one of these procedures is unable to deliver an @r{exact}
result when given @r{exact} arguments, then it may either report a
violation of an
implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an
@r{inexact} number; such a coercion can cause an error later.
Nevertheless, implementations that do not provide @r{exact} rational
numbers should return @r{inexact} rational numbers rather than
reporting an implementation restriction.

An implementation may use floating-point and other approximate 
representation strategies for @r{inexact} numbers.
This report recommends, but does not require, that 
implementations that use
floating-point representations
follow the IEEE 754 standard,
and that implementations using
other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
using these floating-point standards [IEEE].
In particular, the description of transcendental functions in IEEE 754-2008
should be followed by such implementations, particularly with respect
to infinities and NaNs.

Although Scheme allows a variety of written
notations for
numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are @r{real}
need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex
numbers.  If an implementation encounters an @r{exact} numerical constant that
it cannot represent as an @r{exact} number, then it may either report a
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the
constant by an @r{inexact} number.

@subsection Implementation extensions

@cindex @w{implementation extension}

Implementations may provide more than one representation of
floating-point numbers with differing precisions.  In an implementation
which does so, an inexact result must be represented with at least
as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact arguments
to that operation.  Although it is desirable for potentially inexact
operations such as @samp{sqrt} to produce @r{exact} answers when
applied to @r{exact} arguments, if an @r{exact} number is operated
upon so as to produce an @r{inexact} result, then the most precise
representation available must be used.  For example, the value of @samp{(sqrt 4)} should be @samp{2}, but in an implementation that provides both
single and double precision floating point numbers it may be the latter
but must not be the former.

It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using inexact
number objects with magnitude or significand too large to be
represented in the implementation.

In addition, implementations may
distinguish special numbers called @r{positive infinity},
@r{negative infinity}, @r{NaN}, and @r{negative zero}.

Positive infinity is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational)
number that represents an indeterminate value greater than the
numbers represented by all rational numbers. Negative infinity
is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number that
represents an indeterminate value less than the numbers represented
by all rational numbers.

Adding or multiplying an infinite value by any finite real value results
in an appropriately signed infinity; however, the sum of positive and
negative infinities is a NaN.  Positive infinity is the reciprocal
of zero, and negative infinity is the reciprocal of negative zero.
The behavior of the transcendental functions is sensitive to infinity
in accordance with IEEE 754.

A NaN is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number
so indeterminate that it might represent any real value, including
positive or negative infinity, and might even be greater than positive
infinity or less than negative infinity.
An implementation that does not support non-real numbers may use NaN
to represent non-real values like @samp{(sqrt -1.0)} and @samp{(asin 2.0)}.

A NaN always compares false to any number, including a NaN.  
An arithmetic operation where one operand is NaN returns NaN, unless the
implementation can prove that the result would be the same if the NaN
were replaced by any rational number.  Dividing zero by zero results in
NaN unless both zeros are exact.

@c % IEEE 754 specifies multiple NaN values.  Scheme generally does
@c % not care if there is a single value (bit pattern) for NaN,
@c % or if there are multiple values: if there are multiple NaN
@c % values, or just one, they are all equivalent in terms of Scheme
@c % computation.

Negative zero is an inexact real value written @samp{-0.0} and is distinct
(in the sense of @samp{eqv?}) from @samp{0.0}.  A Scheme implementation
is not required to distinguish negative zero.  If it does, however, the
behavior of the transcendental functions is sensitive to the distinction
in accordance with IEEE 754.
Specifically, in a Scheme implementing both complex numbers and negative zero,
the branch cut of the complex logarithm function is such that
@samp{(imag-part (log -1.0-0.0i))} is -pi rather than pi.

Furthermore, the negation of negative zero is ordinary zero and vice
versa.  This implies that the sum of two or more negative zeros is negative,
and the result of subtracting (positive) zero from a negative zero is
likewise negative.  However, numerical comparisons treat negative zero
as equal to zero.

Note that both the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number
can be infinities, NaNs, or negative zero.

@node Syntax of numerical constants, Numerical operations, Implementation extensions, Numbers
@subsection Syntax of numerical constants

@cindex @w{syntax of numerical constants}


The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described formally in
section @ref{Lexical structure}.  Note that case is not significant in numerical
constants.

A number can be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexa@-decimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are @samp{#b} (binary), @samp{#o} (octal), @samp{#d} (decimal), and @samp{#x} (hexa@-decimal).  With
@vindex #x
@vindex #d
@vindex #o
@vindex #b
no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.

A
numerical constant can be specified to be either @r{exact} or
@r{inexact} by a prefix.  The prefixes are @samp{#e}
@vindex #e
for @r{exact}, and @samp{#i} for @r{inexact}.  An exactness
@vindex #i
prefix can appear before or after any radix prefix that is used.  If
the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the
constant is
@r{inexact} if it contains a decimal point or an
exponent.
Otherwise, it is @r{exact}.

In systems with @r{inexact} numbers
of varying precisions it can be useful to specify
the precision of a constant.  For this purpose,
implementations may accept numerical constants
written with an exponent marker that indicates the
desired precision of the @r{inexact}
representation.  If so, the letter @samp{s}, @samp{f},
@samp{d}, or @samp{l}, meaning @var{short}, @var{single},
@var{double}, or @var{long} precision, respectively,
can be used in place of @samp{e}.
The default precision has at least as much precision
as @var{double}, but
implementations may allow this default to be set by the user.


@example

3.14159265358979F0
       @r{Round to single ---} 3.141593
0.6L0
       @r{Extend to long ---} .600000000000000

@end example


The numbers positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN are written
@samp{+inf.0}, @samp{-inf.0} and @samp{+nan.0} respectively.
NaN may also be written @samp{-nan.0}.
The use of signs in the written representation does not necessarily
reflect the underlying sign of the NaN value, if any.
Implementations are not required to support these numbers, but if they do,
they must do so in general conformance with IEEE 754.  However, implementations
are not required to support signaling NaNs, nor to provide a way to distinguish
between different NaNs.

There are two notations provided for non-real complex numbers:
the @dfn{rectangular notation}
@cindex @w{rectangular notation}
@var{a}@samp{+}@var{b}@samp{i},
where @var{a} is the real part and @var{b} is the imaginary part;
and the @dfn{polar notation}
@cindex @w{polar notation}
@var{r}@samp{@@}theta,
where @var{r} is the magnitude and theta is the phase (angle) in radians.
These are related by the equation
a+b@r{i} = r costheta + (r sintheta) @r{i}.
All of @var{a}, @var{b}, @var{r}, and theta are real numbers.

The reader is referred to section @ref{Entry format} for a summary
of the naming conventions used to specify restrictions on the types of
arguments to numerical routines.
The examples used in this section assume that any numerical constant written
using an @r{exact} notation is indeed represented as an @r{exact}
number.  Some examples also assume that certain numerical constants written
using an @r{inexact} notation can be represented without loss of
accuracy; the @r{inexact} constants were chosen so that this is
likely to be true in implementations that use IEEE binary doubles to represent
inexact numbers.

quotient of their arguments, associating to the left.  With one argument,
however, they return the additive or multiplicative inverse of their argument.

It is an error if any argument of @samp{/} other than the first is an exact zero.
If the first argument is an exact zero, an implementation may return an
exact zero unless one of the other arguments is a NaN.

@deffnx {procedure} truncate/  n1 n2
@deffnx {procedure} truncate-quotient  n1 n2
@deffnx {procedure} truncate-remainder  n1 n2

These procedures implement
number-theoretic (integer) division.  It is an error if @var{n2} is zero.
The procedures ending in @samp{/} return two integers; the other
procedures return an integer.  All the procedures compute a
quotient @var{n_q} and remainder @var{n_r} such that
@var{n1} = @var{n2} @var{n_q} + @var{n_r}.  For each of the 
division operators, there are three procedures defined as follows:


@format
@t{(@r{<operator>}/ @var{n1} @var{n2})                    ==> @var{n_q} @var{n_r}

(@r{<operator>}-remainder @var{n1} @var{n2})           ==> @var{n_r}
}
@end format


The remainder @var{n_r} is determined by the choice of integer
@var{n_q}: @var{n_r} = @var{n1} - @var{n2} @var{n_q}.  Each set of
operators uses a different choice of @var{n_q}:

The @samp{ceiling} procedure returns the smallest integer not smaller than @var{x},
@samp{truncate} returns the integer closest to @var{x} whose absolute

@deffn {procedure} rationalize  x y


The @samp{rationalize} procedure returns the @emph{simplest} rational number
differing from @var{x} by no more than @var{y}.  A rational number r_1 is
@emph{simpler}  than another rational number
@cindex @w{simplest rational}
r_2 if r_1 = p_1/q_1 and r_2 = p_2/q_2 (in lowest terms) and |p_1|<= |p_2| and |q_1| <= |q_2|.  Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7.
Although not all rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7
and 3/5), any interval contains a rational number that is simpler than
every other rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies
between 2/7 and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of
all.

@deffnx {inexact library procedure} acos  @var{z}
@deffnx {inexact library procedure} atan  @var{z}
@deffnx {inexact library procedure} atan  @var{y} @var{x}

These procedures 
compute the usual transcendental functions.  The @samp{log} procedure
computes the natural logarithm of @var{z} (not the base ten logarithm)
if a single argument is given, or the base-@var{z2} logarithm of @var{z1}
if two arguments are given.
The @samp{asin}, @samp{acos}, and @samp{atan} procedures compute arcsine (sin^-1),
arc-cosine (cos^-1), and arctangent (tan^-1), respectively.
The two-argument variant of @samp{atan} computes @t{(angle
(make-rectangular @var{x} @var{y}))} (see below), even in implementations
that don't support complex numbers.

In general, the mathematical functions log, arcsine, arc-cosine, and
arctangent are multiply defined.
The value of log z is defined to be the one whose imaginary part
lies in the range from -pi (inclusive if @samp{-0.0} is distinguished,
exclusive otherwise) to pi (inclusive).
The value of log 0 is mathematically undefined.
With log defined this way, the values of sin^-1 z, cos^-1 z,
and tan^-1 z are according to the following formulae:


@center sin^-1 z = -i log (i z + sqrt1 - z^2)



@center cos^-1 z = pi / 2 - sin^-1 z



@center tan^-1 z = (log (1 + i z) - log (1 - i z)) / (2 i)


However, @samp{(log 0.0)} returns @samp{-inf.0} 
(and @samp{(log -0.0)} returns @samp{-inf.0+pii}) if the
implementation supports infinities (and @samp{-0.0}).

The range of @t{(@samp{atan} @var{y} @var{x})} is as in the

@deffn {procedure} inexact  @var{z}

@r{inexact} number that is numerically closest to the argument.  
For inexact arguments, the result is the same as the argument. For exact
complex numbers, the result is a complex number whose real and imaginary
parts are the result of applying @samp{inexact} to the real
and imaginary parts of the argument, respectively.
If an @r{exact} argument has no reasonably close @r{inexact} equivalent
(in the sense of @samp{=}),
then a violation of an implementation restriction may be reported.

The procedure @samp{exact} returns an @r{exact} representation of
@var{z}.  The value returned is the @r{exact} number that is numerically
closest to the argument.
For exact arguments, the result is the same as the argument. For inexact
non-integral real arguments, the implementation may return a rational
approximation, or may report an implementation violation. For inexact
complex arguments, the result is a complex number whose real and
imaginary parts are the result of applying @samp{exact} to the
real and imaginary parts of the argument, respectively.
If an @r{inexact} argument has no reasonably close @r{exact} equivalent,
(in the sense of @samp{=}),
then a violation of an implementation restriction may be reported.

These procedures implement the natural one-to-one correspondence between
@r{exact} and @r{inexact} integers throughout an
implementation-dependent range.  See section @ref{Implementation restrictions}.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
These procedures were known in R@sup{5}RS as @samp{exact->inexact} and

@deffn {procedure} number->string  z
@deffnx {procedure} number->string  z radix

It is an error if @var{radix} is not one of 2, 8, 10, or 16.
The procedure @samp{number->string} takes a
number and a radix and returns as a string an external representation of
the given number in the given radix such that

@format
@t{(let ((number @var{number})
      (radix @var{radix}))

}
@end format

is true.  It is an error if no possible result makes this expression true.
If omitted, @var{radix} defaults to 10.

If @var{z} is inexact, the radix is 10, and the above expression
can be satisfied by a result that contains a decimal point,
then the result contains a decimal point and is expressed using the
minimum number of digits (exclusive of exponent and trailing
zeroes) needed to make the above expression
true [howtoprint], [howtoread];
otherwise the format of the result is unspecified.

The result returned by @samp{number->string}
never contains an explicit radix prefix.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The error case can occur only when @var{z} is not a complex number
or is a complex number with a non-rational real or imaginary part.
@end quotation



@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
If @var{z} is an inexact number and
the radix is 10, then the above expression is normally satisfied by
a result containing a decimal point.  The unspecified case
allows for infinities, NaNs, and unusual representations.

@deffn {procedure} string->number  string

Returns a number of the maximally precise representation expressed by the

It is an error if @var{radix} is not 2, 8, 10, or 16.
If supplied, @var{radix} is a default radix that will be overridden
if an explicit radix prefix is present in @var{string} (e.g. @t{"#o177"}).  If @var{radix}
is not supplied, then the default radix is 10.  If @var{string} is not
a syntactically valid notation for a number, or would result in a
number that the implementation cannot represent, then @samp{string->number}
returns @t{#f}.
An error is never signaled due to the content of @var{string}.

@end format



@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The domain of @samp{string->number} may be restricted by implementations
in the following ways.  
If all numbers supported by an implementation are real, then
@samp{string->number} is permitted to return @t{#f} whenever
@var{string} uses the polar or rectangular notations for complex
numbers.  If all numbers are integers, then
@samp{string->number} may return @t{#f} whenever
the fractional notation is used.  If all numbers are exact, then
@samp{string->number} may return @t{#f} whenever
an exponent marker or explicit exactness prefix is used.
If all inexact
numbers are integers, then
@samp{string->number} may return @t{#f} whenever
a decimal point is used.

The rules used by a particular implementation for @samp{string->number} must
also be applied to @samp{read} and to the routine that reads programs, in
order to maintain consistency between internal numeric processing, I/O,
and the processing of programs.
As a consequence, the R@sup{5}RS permission to return @t{#f} when
@var{string} has an explicit radix prefix has been withdrawn.

The standard boolean objects for true and false are written as
@t{#t} and @t{#f}.  
@vindex #f
@vindex #t
Alternatively, they can be written @t{#true} and @t{#false},
respectively.  What really
matters, though, are the objects that the Scheme conditional expressions
(@samp{if}, @samp{cond}, @samp{and}, @samp{or}, @samp{when}, @samp{unless}, @samp{do}) treat as
true or false.  The phrase ``a true value''
@cindex @w{false}
@cindex @w{true}
(or sometimes just ``true'') means any object treated as true by the
conditional expressions, and the phrase ``a false value'' (or
``false'') means any object treated as false by the conditional expressions.

Of all the Scheme values, only @t{#f}
counts as false in conditional expressions.
All other Scheme values, including @t{#t},
count as true.

@cindex @w{pairs and lists}


A @dfn{pair} (sometimes called a @dfn{dotted pair}) is a
@cindex @w{dotted pair}
@cindex @w{pair}
record structure with two fields called the car and cdr fields (for
historical reasons).  Pairs are created by the procedure @samp{cons}.
The car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures @samp{car} and
@samp{cdr}.  The car and cdr fields are assigned by the procedures
@samp{set-car!} and @samp{set-cdr!}.

Pairs are used primarily to represent lists.  A @dfn{list} can
@cindex @w{list}
be defined recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose
@cindex @w{empty list}
cdr is a list.  More precisely, the set of lists is defined as the smallest
set @var{X} such that



@itemize @bullet

@item
The empty list is in @var{X}.
@item
If @var{list} is in @var{X}, then any pair whose cdr field contains
@var{list} is also in @var{X}.

@end itemize


The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are the
elements of the list.  For example, a two-element list is a pair whose car
is the first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the second element
and whose cdr is the empty list.  The length of a list is the number of
elements, which is the same as the number of pairs.

The empty list is a special object of its own type.
It is not a pair, it has no elements, and its length is zero.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The above definitions imply that all lists have finite length and are
terminated by the empty list.
@end quotation


The most general notation (external representation) for Scheme pairs is
the ``dotted'' notation @w{@samp{(@var{c1} .@: @var{c2})}} where
@var{c1} is the value of the car field and @var{c2} is the value of the
cdr field.  For example @samp{(4 .@: 5)} is a pair whose car is 4 and whose
cdr is 5.  Note that @samp{(4 .@: 5)} is the external representation of a
pair, not an expression that evaluates to a pair.

A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the elements of the
list are simply enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces.  The
empty list is written @t{()}.  For example,


@example

(a b c d e)

@end example


and


@example

(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))

@end example


are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.

A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
@dfn{improper list}.  Note that an improper list is not a list.
@cindex @w{improper list}
The list and dotted notations can be combined to represent
improper lists:


@example

(a b c . d)

@end example


is equivalent to


@example

(a . (b . (c . d)))

@end example


Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored in the cdr
field.  When the @code{set-cdr!} procedure is used, an object can be a
@vindex @w{set-cdr!}
list one moment and not the next:


@example

(define x (list 'a 'b 'c))
(define y x)
y                                      ==>  (a b c)
(list? y)                              ==>  #t
(set-cdr! x 4)                         ==>  @emph{unspecified}
x                                      ==>  (a . 4)
(eqv? x y)                             ==>  #t
y                                      ==>  (a . 4)
(list? y)                              ==>  #f
(set-cdr! x x)                         ==>  @emph{unspecified}
(list? x)                              ==>  #f

@end example


Within literal expressions and representations of objects read by the
@code{read} procedure, the forms @t{'}@r{<datum>},
@vindex '
@vindex @w{read}
@t{`}@r{<datum>}, @t{,}@r{<datum>}, and
@vindex ,
@t{,@@}@r{<datum>} denote two-ele@-ment lists whose first elements are
the symbols @code{quote}, @code{quasiquote}, @w{@code{unquote}}, and
@vindex @w{unquote}
@vindex @w{quasiquote}
@vindex @w{quote}
@code{unquote-splicing}, respectively.  The second element in each case
@vindex @w{unquote-splicing}
is @r{<datum>}.  This convention is supported so that arbitrary Scheme
programs can be represented as lists.  
That is, according to Scheme's grammar, every
<expression> is also a <datum> (see section @pxref{External representation}).
Among other things, this permits the use of the @samp{read} procedure to
parse Scheme programs.  See section @ref{External representations}.

@deffn {procedure} make-list  k
@deffnx {procedure} make-list  k fill

Returns a newly allocated list of @var{k} elements.  If a second

@deffn {procedure} append  list @dots{}

The last argument, if there is one, can be of any type.
Returns a list consisting of the elements of the first @var{list}
followed by the elements of the other @var{list}s.
If there are no arguments, the empty list is returned.
If there is exactly one argument, it is returned.
Otherwise the resulting list is always newly allocated, except that it shares

@deffn {procedure} list-tail  list @var{k}

It is an error if @var{list} has fewer than @var{k} elements.
Returns the sublist of @var{list} obtained by omitting the first @var{k}
elements.
The @samp{list-tail} procedure could be defined by


@format
@t{(define list-tail

@deffn {procedure} list-ref  list @var{k}

The @var{list} argument can be circular, but
it is an error if @var{list} has @var{k} or fewer elements.
Returns the @var{k}th element of @var{list}.  (This is the same

@deffn {procedure} memq  obj list
@deffnx {procedure} memv  obj list
@deffnx {procedure} member  obj list
@deffnx {procedure} member  obj list compare

These procedures return the first sublist of @var{list} whose car is
@var{obj}, where the sublists of @var{list} are the non-empty lists
returned by @t{(list-tail @var{list} @var{k})} for @var{k} less
than the length of @var{list}.  If
@var{obj} does not occur in @var{list}, then @t{#f} (not the empty list) is
returned.  The @samp{memq} procedure uses @samp{eq?} to compare @var{obj} with the elements of
@var{list}, while @samp{memv} uses @samp{eqv?} and 
@samp{member} uses @var{compare}, if given, and @samp{equal?} otherwise.

@deffn {procedure} assq  obj alist

@deffnx {procedure} assoc  obj alist
@deffnx {procedure} assoc  obj alist compare

It is an error if @var{alist} (for ``association list'') is not a list of
pairs.
These procedures find the first pair in @var{alist} whose car field is @var{obj},
and returns that pair.  If no pair in @var{alist} has @var{obj} as its
car, then @t{#f} (not the empty list) is returned.  The @samp{assq} procedure uses
@samp{eq?} to compare @var{obj} with the car fields of the pairs in @var{alist},
while @samp{assv} uses @samp{eqv?} and @samp{assoc} uses @var{compare} if given

Although they are often used as predicates,
@samp{memq}, @samp{memv}, @samp{member}, @samp{assq}, @samp{assv}, and @samp{assoc} do not

@deffn {procedure} list-copy  obj

Returns a newly allocated copy of the given @var{obj} if it is a list.
Only the pairs themselves are copied; the cars of the result are

If @var{obj} is an improper list, so is the result, and the final
cdrs are the same in the sense of @samp{eqv?}.
An @var{obj} which is not a list is returned unchanged.
It is an error if @var{obj} is a circular list.

@cindex @w{symbols}


Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that two
symbols are identical (in the sense of @samp{eqv?}) if and only if their
names are spelled the same way.  For instance, they can be used
the way enumerated values are used in other languages.

The rules for writing a symbol are exactly the same as the rules for
writing an identifier; see sections @ref{Identifiers}
and @ref{Lexical structure}.

It is guaranteed that any symbol that has been returned as part of
a literal expression, or read using the @samp{read} procedure, and
subsequently written out using the @samp{write} procedure, will read back
in as the identical symbol (in the sense of @samp{eqv?}).


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
Some implementations have values known as ``uninterned symbols,''
which defeat write/read invariance, and also violate the rule that two
symbols are the same if and only if their names are spelled the same.
This report does not specify the behavior of
implementation-dependent extensions.

@section Characters

@cindex @w{characters}


Characters are objects that represent printed characters such as
letters and digits.  
All Scheme implementations must support at least the ASCII character
repertoire: that is, Unicode characters U+0000 through U+007F.
Implementations may support any other Unicode characters they see fit,
and may also support non-Unicode characters as well.
Except as otherwise specified, the result of applying any of the
following procedures to a non-Unicode character is implementation-dependent.

Characters are written using the notation #\@r{<character>}
or #\@r{<character name>} or
#\x<hex scalar value>.

The following character names must be supported
by all implementations with the given values.  
Implementations may add other names
provided they cannot be interpreted as hex scalar values preceded by @samp{x}.



@center @c begin-tabular
@quotation
@table @asis
@item @t{#\alarm}
; @r{U+0007}
@item @t{#\backspace}
; @r{U+0008}
@item @t{#\delete}
; @r{U+007F}
@item @t{#\escape}
; @r{U+001B}
@item @t{#\newline}
; the linefeed character, @r{U+000A}
@item @t{#\null}
; the null character, @r{U+0000}
@item @t{#\return}
; the return character, @r{U+000D}
@item @t{#\space}
; the preferred way to write a space
@item @t{#\tab}
; the tab character, @r{U+0009}
@item 
@end table
@end quotation




Here are some additional examples:



@center @c begin-tabular

@table @asis
@item @t{#\a}
; lower case letter
@item @t{#\A}
; upper case letter
@item @t{#\(}
; left parenthesis

; the space character
@item @t{#\x03BB}
; lambda (if character is supported)
@item @t{#\iota}
; iota (if character and name are supported)
@item 
@end table
@end quotation




Case is significant in #\@r{<character>}, and in
#\@r{<character name>},
but not in @samp{#\x}<hex scalar value>.  
If @r{<character>} in
#\@r{<character>} is alphabetic, then any character
immediately following @r{<character>} cannot be one that can appear in an identifier.
This rule resolves the ambiguous case where, for
example, the sequence of characters ``@t{#\ space}''
could be taken to be either a representation of the space character or a
representation of the character ``@t{#\ s}'' followed
by a representation of the symbol ``@t{pace}.''

@ignore todo
Fix
@end ignore

Characters written in the #\ notation are self-evaluating.
That is, they do not have to be quoted in programs.  

Some of the procedures that operate on characters ignore the
difference between upper case and lower case.  The procedures that
ignore case have @w{``@t{-ci}''} (for ``case
insensitive'') embedded in their names.



@deffn {procedure} char?  obj

Returns @t{#t} if @var{obj} is a character, otherwise returns @t{#f}.

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} char=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {procedure} char<?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {procedure} char>?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {procedure} char<=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {procedure} char>=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}



These procedures return @t{#t} if 
the results of passing their arguments to @samp{char->integer}
are respectively
equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing,
monotonically non-decreasing, or monotonically non-increasing.

These predicates are required to be transitive.

@end deffn



@deffn {char library procedure} char-ci=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-ci<?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}

@deffnx {char library procedure} char-ci<=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-ci>=?  char1 char2 char3 @dots{}

These procedures are similar to @samp{char=?} et cetera, but they treat
upper case and lower case letters as the same.  For example, @samp{(char-ci=? #\A #\a)} returns @t{#t}.

Specifically, these procedures behave as if @samp{char-foldcase} were
applied to their arguments before they were compared.

@end deffn



@deffn {char library procedure} char-alphabetic?  char
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-numeric?  char
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-whitespace?  char
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-upper-case?  letter
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-lower-case?  letter

These procedures return @t{#t} if their arguments are alphabetic,
numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters, respectively,
otherwise they return @t{#f}.  

Specifically, they must return @t{#t} when applied to characters with
the Unicode properties Alphabetic, Numeric Type=Decimal,
White Space, Uppercase, and
Lowercase respectively, and @t{#f} when applied to any other Unicode
characters.  Note that many Unicode characters are alphabetic but neither
upper nor lower case.

@end deffn



@deffn {char library procedure} digit-value  char

This procedure returns the numeric value (0 to 9) of its argument
if it is a numeric digit (that is, if @samp{char-numeric?} returns @t{#t}),
or @t{#f} on any other character.


@format
@t{(digit-value #\3)                      ==> 3

(digit-value #\x0AE6)                  ==> 0
(digit-value #\x0EA6)                  ==> #f
}
@end format

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} char->integer  char
@deffnx {procedure} integer->char  @var{n}

Given a Unicode character, 
@samp{char->integer} returns an exact integer 
between 0 and @t{#xD7FF} or 
between @t{#xE000} and @t{#x10FFFF} 
which is equal to the Unicode scalar value of that character.
Given a non-Unicode character, 
it returns an exact integer greater than @t{#x10FFFF}.  
This is true independent of whether the implementation uses
the Unicode representation internally.

Given an exact integer that is the value returned by
a character when @samp{char->integer} is applied to it, @samp{integer->char}
returns that character.
@end deffn



@deffn {char library procedure} char-upcase  char
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-downcase  char
@deffnx {char library procedure} char-foldcase  char


The @samp{char-upcase} procedure, given an argument that is the
lowercase part of a Unicode casing pair, returns the uppercase member
of the pair, provided that both characters are supported by the Scheme
implementation.  Note that language-sensitive casing pairs are not used.  If the
argument is not the lowercase member of such a pair, it is returned.

The @samp{char-downcase} procedure, given an argument that is the
uppercase part of a Unicode casing pair, returns the lowercase member
of the pair, provided that both characters are supported by the Scheme
implementation.  Note that language-sensitive casing pairs are not used.  If the
argument is not the uppercase member of such a pair, it is returned.

The @samp{char-foldcase} procedure applies the Unicode simple
case-folding algorithm to its argument and returns the result.  Note that
language-sensitive folding is not used.  
If the character that results from folding
is not supported by the implementation,
the argument is returned.
See UAX #44 [uax44] (part of the Unicode Standard) for details.

Note that many Unicode lowercase characters do not have uppercase
equivalents.

@node Strings, Vectors, Characters, Standard procedures
@section Strings

@cindex @w{strings}


Strings are sequences of characters.  
Strings are written as sequences of characters enclosed within quotation marks
(@samp{"}).  Within a string literal, various escape
sequences represent characters other than
@cindex @w{escape sequence}
themselves.  Escape sequences always start with a backslash (\):



@itemize @bullet

@item @samp{\a} : alarm, U+0007
@item @samp{\b} : backspace, U+0008 
@item @samp{\t} : character tabulation, U+0009 
@item @samp{\n} : linefeed, U+000A 
@item @samp{\r} : return, U+000D 
@item @samp{\}" : double quote, U+0022 
@item @samp{\\} : backslash, U+005C 
@item @samp{\|} : vertical line, U+007C
@item @samp{\@r{<intraline whitespace>}*@r{<line ending>}
@r{<intraline whitespace>}*} : nothing
@item @samp{\x<hex scalar value>;} : specified character (note the
terminating semi-colon).

@end itemize


The result is unspecified if any other character in a string occurs
after a backslash.

Except for a line ending, any character outside of an escape
sequence stands for itself in the string literal.  A line ending which
is preceded by @samp{\@r{<intraline whitespace>}} expands
to nothing (along with any trailing intraline whitespace), and can be
used to indent strings for improved legibility. Any other line ending
has the same effect as inserting a @samp{\n} character into
the string.

Examples:


@example

"The word \"recursion\" has many meanings."
"Another example:\ntwo lines of text"
"Here's text \ 
   containing just one line"
"\x03B1; is named GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA."

@end example


The @emph{length} of a string is the number of characters that it
contains.  This number is an exact, non-negative integer that is fixed when the
string is created.  The @dfn{valid indexes} of a string are the
@cindex @w{valid indexes}
exact non-negative integers less than the length of the string.  The first
character of a string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.


Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the
difference between upper and lower case.  The names of the versions that ignore case
end with @w{``@samp{-ci}''} (for ``case insensitive'').

Implementations may forbid certain characters from appearing in strings.
However, with the exception of @t{#\null}, ASCII characters must
not be forbidden.
For example, an implementation might support the entire Unicode repertoire,
but only allow characters U+0001 to U+00FF (the Latin-1 repertoire
without @t{#\null}) in strings.

It is an error to pass such a forbidden character to
@samp{make-string}, @samp{string}, @samp{string-set!}, or @samp{string-fill!},
as part of the list passed to @samp{list->string},
or as part of the vector passed to @samp{vector->string}
(see section @pxref{Vectors}),
or in UTF-8 encoded form within a bytevector passed to
@samp{utf8->string} (see section @pxref{Bytevectors}).
It is also an error for a procedure passed to @samp{string-map}
(see section @pxref{Control features}) to return a forbidden character,
or for @samp{read-string} (see section @pxref{Input})
to attempt to read one.


@deffn {procedure} string?  obj

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} make-string  @var{k}
@deffnx {procedure} make-string  @var{k} char

The @samp{make-string} procedure returns a newly allocated string of
length @var{k}.  If @var{char} is given, then all the characters of the string
are initialized to @var{char}, otherwise the contents of the
string are unspecified.

@end deffn

It is an error if @var{k} is not a valid index of @var{string}.
The @samp{string-ref} procedure returns character @var{k} of @var{string} using zero-origin indexing.
@end deffn
There is no requirement for this procedure to execute in constant time.



@deffn {procedure} string-set!  string k char

It is an error if @var{k} is not a valid index of @var{string}.
The @samp{string-set!} procedure stores @var{char} in element @var{k} of @var{string}.
There is no requirement for this procedure to execute in constant time.

@deffn {procedure} string=?  string1 string2 string3 @dots{}

Returns @t{#t} if all the strings are the same length and contain
exactly the same characters in the same positions, otherwise returns
@t{#f}.

@end deffn


@deffn {char library procedure} string-ci=?  string1 string2 string3 @dots{}

Returns @t{#t} if, after case-folding, all the strings are the same
length and contain the same characters in the same positions, otherwise
returns @t{#f}.  Specifically, these procedures behave as if 
@samp{string-foldcase} were applied to their arguments before comparing them.

@deffnx {procedure} string>=?  string1 string2 string3 @dots{}
@deffnx {char library procedure} string-ci>=?  string1 string2 string3 @dots{}

These procedures return @t{#t} if their arguments are (respectively):
monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing,
monotonically non-decreasing, or monotonically non-increasing.

These predicates are required to be transitive.

These procedures compare strings in an implementation-defined way.
One approach is to make them the lexicographic extensions to strings of
the corresponding orderings on characters.  In that case, @samp{string<?}
would be the lexicographic ordering on strings induced by the ordering
@samp{char<?} on characters, and if the two strings differ in length but
are the same up to the length of the shorter string, the shorter string
would be considered to be lexicographically less than the longer string.
However, it is also permitted to use the natural ordering imposed by the
implementation's internal representation of strings, or a more complex locale-specific
ordering.

In all cases, a pair of strings must satisfy exactly one of
@samp{string<?}, @samp{string=?}, and @samp{string>?}, and must satisfy
@samp{string<=?} if and only if they do not satisfy @samp{string>?} and
@samp{string>=?} if and only if they do not satisfy @samp{string<?}.

The @w{``@t{-ci}''} procedures behave as if they applied
@samp{string-foldcase} to their arguments before invoking the corresponding
procedures without  @w{``@t{-ci}''}.


@end deffn


@deffn {char library procedure} string-upcase  string
@deffnx {char library procedure} string-downcase  string
@deffnx {char library procedure} string-foldcase  string


These procedures apply the Unicode full string uppercasing, lowercasing,
and case-folding algorithms to their arguments and return the result.
In certain cases, the result differs in length from the argument.
If the result is equal to the argument in the sense of @samp{string=?}, the argument may be returned.
Note that language-sensitive mappings and foldings are not used.  

The Unicode Standard prescribes special treatment of the Greek letter
Sigma, whose normal lower-case form is sigma but which becomes
varsigma at the end of a word.  See UAX #44 [uax44] (part of
the Unicode Standard) for details.  However, implementations of @samp{string-downcase} are not required to provide this behavior, and may
choose to change Sigma to sigma in all cases.

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} substring  string start end

The @samp{substring} procedure returns a newly allocated string formed from the characters of
@var{string} beginning with index @var{start} and ending with index
@var{end}.
This is equivalent to calling @samp{string-copy} with the same arguments,
but is provided for backward compatibility and
stylistic flexibility.

@deffnx {procedure} string->list  string start end
@deffnx {procedure} list->string  list

It is an error if any element of @var{list} is not a character.
The @samp{string->list} procedure returns a newly allocated list of the
characters of @var{string} between @var{start} and @var{end}.
@samp{list->string}
returns a newly allocated string formed from the elements in the list
@var{list}.
In both procedures, order is preserved.
@samp{string->list}

@deffn {procedure} string-copy!  to at from
@deffnx {procedure} string-copy!  to at from start
@deffnx {procedure} string-copy!  to at from start end

It is an error if @var{at} is less than zero or greater than the length of @var{to}.
It is also an error if @samp{(- (string-length @var{to}) @var{at})}
is less than @samp{(- @var{end} @var{start})}.
Copies the characters of string @var{from} between @var{start} and @var{end}
to string @var{to}, starting at @var{at}.  The order in which characters are
copied is unspecified, except that if the source and destination overlap,
copying takes place as if the source is first copied into a temporary
string and then into the destination.  This can be achieved without
allocating storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in
such circumstances.


@format
@t{(define a "12345")

@node Vectors, Bytevectors, Strings, Standard procedures
@section Vectors

@cindex @w{vectors}


Vectors are heterogeneous structures whose elements are indexed
by integers.  A vector typically occupies less space than a list
of the same length, and the average time needed to access a randomly
chosen element is typically less for the vector than for the list.

The @emph{length} of a vector is the number of elements that it
contains.  This number is a non-negative integer that is fixed when the
vector is created.  The @emph{valid indexes} of a
@cindex @w{valid indexes}
vector are the exact non-negative integers less than the length of the
vector.  The first element in a vector is indexed by zero, and the last
element is indexed by one less than the length of the vector.

Vectors are written using the notation @t{#(@var{obj} @dots{})}.
For example, a vector of length 3 containing the number zero in element
0, the list @samp{(2 2 2 2)} in element 1, and the string @samp{"Anna"} in
element 2 can be written as follows:


@example

#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")

@end example


Vector constants are self-evaluating, so they do not need to be quoted in programs.

@section Bytevectors

@cindex @w{bytevectors}


@dfn{Bytevectors} represent blocks of binary data.
They are fixed-length sequences of bytes, where
a @dfn{byte} is an exact integer in the range from 0 to 255 inclusive.
@cindex @w{byte}
A bytevector is typically more space-efficient than a vector
containing the same values.

The @emph{length} of a bytevector is the number of elements that it
contains.  This number is a non-negative integer that is fixed when
the bytevector is created.  The @emph{valid indexes} of
@cindex @w{valid indexes}
a bytevector are the exact non-negative integers less than the length of the
bytevector, starting at index zero as with vectors.

Bytevectors are written using the notation @t{#u8(@var{byte} @dots{})}.
For example, a bytevector of length 3 containing the byte 0 in element
0, the byte 10 in element 1, and the byte 5 in
element 2 can be written as follows:


@example

#u8(0 10 5)

@end example


Bytevector constants are self-evaluating, so they do not need to be quoted in programs.

@deffn {procedure} call-with-current-continuation  proc
@deffnx {procedure} call/cc  proc

 It is an error if @var{proc} does not accept one
argument.
The procedure @samp{call-with-current-continuation} (or its
equivalent abbreviation @samp{call/cc}) packages
the current continuation (see the rationale below) as an ``escape
procedure'' and passes it as an argument to
@cindex @w{escape procedure}
@var{proc}.
The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is
later called, will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that later
time and will instead use the continuation that was in effect
when the escape procedure was created.  Calling the escape procedure
will cause the invocation of @var{before} and @var{after} thunks installed using
@code{dynamic-wind}.
@vindex @w{dynamic-wind}

The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the continuation to
the original call to @t{call-with-current-continuation}.
Most continuations take only one value.
Continuations created by the @samp{call-with-values}
procedure (including the initialization expressions of
@samp{define-values}, @samp{let-values}, and @samp{let*-values} expressions),
take the number of values that the consumer expects.
The continuations of all non-final expressions within a sequence
of expressions, such as in @samp{lambda}, @samp{case-lambda}, @samp{begin},
@samp{let}, @samp{let*}, @samp{letrec}, @samp{letrec*}, @samp{let-values}, 
@samp{let*-values}, @samp{let-syntax}, @samp{letrec-syntax}, @samp{parameterize},
@samp{guard}, @samp{case}, @samp{cond}, @samp{when}, and @samp{unless} expressions,
take an arbitrary number of values because they discard the values passed
to them in any event.
The effect of passing no values or more than one value to continuations
that were not created in one of these ways is unspecified.


The escape procedure that is passed to @var{proc} has
unlimited extent just like any other procedure in Scheme.  It can be stored
in variables or data structures and can be called as many times as desired.
However, like the @samp{raise} and @samp{error} procedures, it never
returns to its caller.

The following examples show only the simplest ways in which
@samp{call-with-current-continuation} is used.  If all real uses were as
simple as these examples, there would be no need for a procedure with
the power of @samp{call-with-current-continuation}.

@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}

A common use of @samp{call-with-current-continuation} is for
structured, non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies, but in fact
@samp{call-with-current-continuation} is useful for implementing a
wide variety of advanced control structures.
In fact, @samp{raise} and @samp{guard} provide a more structured mechanism
for non-local exits.

Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a
@dfn{continuation} wanting the result of the expression.  The continuation
@cindex @w{continuation}
represents an entire (default) future for the computation.  If the expression is
evaluated at the REPL, for example, then the continuation might take the
result, print it on the screen, prompt for the next input, evaluate it, and
so on forever.  Most of the time the continuation includes actions
specified by user code, as in a continuation that will take the result,
multiply it by the value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give
the answer to the REPL's continuation to be printed.  Normally these
ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and programmers do not
think much about them.  On rare occasions, however, a programmer
needs to deal with continuations explicitly.
The @samp{call-with-current-continuation} procedure allows Scheme programmers to do
that by creating a procedure that acts just like the current
continuation.

@c  \vest Most programming languages incorporate one or more special-purpose
@c  escape constructs with names like {\tt exit}, \hbox{{\cf return}}, or
@c  even {\tt goto}.  In 1965, however, Peter Landin~\cite{Landin65}
@c  invented a general purpose escape operator called the J-operator.  John
@c  Reynolds~\cite{Reynolds72} described a simpler but equally powerful
@c  construct in 1972.  The {\cf catch} syntax described by Sussman
@c  and Steele in the 1975 report on Scheme is exactly the same as
@c  Reynolds's construct, though its name came from a less general construct
@c  in MacLisp.  Several Scheme implementers noticed that the full power of
@c  \ide{catch} could be provided by a procedure instead of by a
@c  special syntactic construct, and the name
@c  {\cf call-with-current-continuation} was coined in 1982.  This name is
@c  descriptive, but opinions differ on the merits of such a long name, and
@c  some people prefer the name \ide{call/cc} instead.

@deffn {procedure} dynamic-wind  before thunk after

Calls @var{thunk} without arguments, returning the result(s) of this call.
@var{Before} and @var{after} are called, also without arguments, as required
by the following rules.  Note that, in the absence of calls to continuations
captured using @code{call-with-current-continuation}, the three arguments are
@vindex @w{call-with-current-continuation}
called once each, in order.  @var{Before} is called whenever execution
enters the dynamic extent of the call to @var{thunk} and @var{after} is called
whenever it exits that dynamic extent.  The dynamic extent of a procedure
call is the period between when the call is initiated and when it
returns.
The @var{before} and @var{after} thunks are called in the same dynamic
environment as the call to @samp{dynamic-wind}.
In Scheme, because of @samp{call-with-current-continuation}, the
dynamic extent of a call is not always a single, connected time period.
It is defined as follows:


@itemize @bullet

@item
The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the body of the
called procedure begins.

@item
The dynamic extent is also entered when execution is not within
the dynamic extent and a continuation is invoked that was captured
(using @samp{call-with-current-continuation}) during the dynamic extent.

@item
It is exited when the called procedure returns.

@item
It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic extent and
a continuation is invoked that was captured while not within the
dynamic extent.

@end itemize


If a second call to @samp{dynamic-wind} occurs within the dynamic extent of the
call to @var{thunk} and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the
@var{after}s from these two invocations of @samp{dynamic-wind} are both to be
called, then the @var{after} associated with the second (inner) call to
@samp{dynamic-wind} is called first.

If a second call to @samp{dynamic-wind} occurs within the dynamic extent of the
call to @var{thunk} and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the
@var{before}s from these two invocations of @samp{dynamic-wind} are both to be
called, then the @var{before} associated with the first (outer) call to
@samp{dynamic-wind} is called first.

If invoking a continuation requires calling the @var{before} from one call
to @samp{dynamic-wind} and the @var{after} from another, then the @var{after}
is called first.

@ignore todo

@end ignore

The effect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit the dynamic
extent of a call to @var{before} or @var{after} is unspecified.

@cindex @w{exceptions}


This section describes Scheme's exception-handling and
exception-raising procedures.
For the concept of Scheme exceptions, see section @ref{Error situations and unspecified behavior}.
See also @ref{guard} for the @samp{guard} syntax.

@dfn{Exception handler}s are one-argument procedures that determine the
@cindex @w{exception handler}
action the program takes when an exceptional situation is signaled.
The system implicitly maintains a current exception handler
in the dynamic environment.

The program raises an exception by
@cindex @w{current exception handler}
invoking the current exception handler, passing it an object
encapsulating information about the exception.  Any procedure
accepting one argument can serve as an exception handler and any
object can be used to represent an exception.


@deffn {procedure} with-exception-handler  @var{handler} @var{thunk}

It is an error if @var{handler} does not accept one argument.
It is also an error if @var{thunk} does not accept zero arguments.
The @samp{with-exception-handler} procedure returns the results of invoking
@var{thunk}.  @var{Handler} is installed as the current
exception handler 
in the dynamic environment used for the invocation of @var{thunk}.


@format
@t{(call-with-current-continuation
 (lambda (k)
  (with-exception-handler
   (lambda (x)
    (display "condition: ")
    (write x)
    (newline)
    (k 'exception))
   (lambda ()
    (+ 1 (raise 'an-error))))))
                                       ==> exception
          @emph{and prints}  condition: an-error

(with-exception-handler
 (lambda (x)
  (display "something went wrong\n"))
 (lambda ()
  (+ 1 (raise 'an-error))))
          @emph{prints}  something went wrong
}
@end format


After printing, the second example then raises another exception.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure} raise  @var{obj}

Raises an exception by invoking the current exception
handler on @var{obj}. The handler is called with the same
dynamic environment as that of the call to @samp{raise}, except that
the current exception handler is the one that was in place when the
handler being called was installed.  If the handler returns, a secondary
exception is raised in the same dynamic environment as the handler.
The relationship between @var{obj} and the object raised by
the secondary exception is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn {procedure} raise-continuable  @var{obj}

Raises an exception by invoking the current
exception handler on @var{obj}. The handler is called with
the same dynamic environment as the call to
@samp{raise-continuable}, except that: (1) the current
exception handler is the one that was in place when the handler being
called was installed, and (2) if the handler being called returns,
then it will again become the current exception handler.  If the
handler returns, the values it returns become the values returned by
the call to @samp{raise-continuable}.
@end deffn


@example

(with-exception-handler
  (lambda (con)
    (cond
      ((string? con)
       (display con))
      (else
       (display "a warning has been issued")))

   @i{prints:} should be a number
                                       ==> 65

@end example



@deffn {procedure} error  @var{message} @var{obj} @dots{}

@var{Message} should be a string.
Raises an exception as if by calling
@samp{raise} on a newly allocated implementation-defined object which encapsulates
the information provided by @var{message},
as well as any @var{obj}s, known as the @dfn{irritants}.
@cindex @w{irritants}

@subsection Ports

@cindex @w{ports}


Ports represent input and output devices.  To Scheme, an input port is
a Scheme object that can deliver data upon command, while an output
port is a Scheme object that can accept data.
@cindex @w{port}
Whether the input and output port types are disjoint is
implementation-dependent.

Different @emph{port types} operate on different data.  Scheme
imple@-men@-ta@-tions are required to support @emph{textual ports}
and @emph{binary ports}, but may also provide other port types.

A textual port supports reading or writing of individual characters
from or to a backing store containing characters
using @samp{read-char} and @samp{write-char} below, and it supports operations
defined in terms of characters, such as @samp{read} and @samp{write}.

A binary port supports reading or writing of individual bytes from
or to a backing store containing bytes using @samp{read-u8} and @samp{write-u8} below, as well as operations defined in terms of bytes.
Whether the textual and binary port types are disjoint is
implementation-dependent.

Ports can be used to access files, devices, and similar things on the host
system on which the Scheme program is running.


@deffn {procedure} call-with-port  port proc

It is an error if @var{proc} does not accept one argument.
The @samp{call-with-port}
procedure calls @var{proc} with @var{port} as an argument.  
If @var{proc} returns,
then the port is closed automatically and the values yielded by the
@var{proc} are returned.  If @var{proc} does not return, then 
the port must not be closed automatically unless it is possible to
prove that the port will never again be used for a read or write
operation.


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
Because Scheme's escape procedures have unlimited extent, it  is
possible to escape from the current continuation but later to resume it. 
If implementations were permitted to close the port on any escape from the
current continuation, then it would be impossible to write portable code using
both @samp{call-with-current-continuation} and @samp{call-with-port}.
@end quotation
 

@end deffn


@deffn {file library procedure} call-with-input-file  string proc
@deffnx {file library procedure} call-with-output-file  string proc

It is an error if @var{proc} does not accept one argument.
These procedures obtain a
textual port obtained by opening the named file for input or output
as if by @samp{open-input-file} or @samp{open-output-file}.  
The port and @var{proc} are then passed to a procedure equivalent
to @samp{call-with-port}.
@end deffn

@deffnx {procedure} output-port?  obj
@deffnx {procedure} textual-port?  obj

textual port, binary port, or any
kind of port, respectively.  Otherwise they return @t{#f}.

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} input-port-open?  port

@deffn {procedure} current-input-port 
@deffnx {procedure} current-output-port 
@deffnx {procedure} current-error-port 

Returns the current default input port, output port, or error port (an
output port), respectively.  These procedures are parameter objects, which can be
overridden with @samp{parameterize} (see
section @pxref{Dynamic bindings}).  The initial bindings for these
are implementation-defined textual ports.

@end deffn



@deffn {file library procedure} with-input-from-file  string thunk
@deffnx {file library procedure} with-output-to-file  string thunk

The file is opened for input or output
as if by @samp{open-input-file} or @samp{open-output-file}, 
and the new port is made to be the value returned by
@samp{current-input-port} or @samp{current-output-port}
(as used by @t{(read)}, @t{(write @var{obj})}, and so forth).
The @var{thunk} is then called with no arguments.  When the @var{thunk} returns,
the port is closed and the previous default is restored.
It is an error if @var{thunk} does not accept zero arguments.
Both procedures return the values yielded by @var{thunk}.
If an escape procedure
is used to escape from the continuation of these procedures, they
behave exactly as if the current input or output port had been bound
dynamically with @samp{parameterize}.

@deffn {file library procedure} open-output-file  string
@deffnx {file library procedure} open-binary-output-file  string

data to a new file by that name.
@ignore todo

@deffnx {procedure} close-input-port  port
@deffnx {procedure} close-output-port  port

Closes the resource associated with @var{port}, rendering the @var{port}
incapable of delivering or accepting data.  
It is an error
to apply the last two procedures to a port which is not an input
or output port, respectively.
Scheme implementations may provide ports which are simultaneously
input and output ports, such as sockets; the @samp{close-input-port}
and @samp{close-output-port} procedures can then be used to close the
input and output sides of the port independently.

These routines have no effect if the port has already been closed.

@deffn {read library procedure} read 
@deffnx {read library procedure} read  port

The @samp{read} procedure converts external representations of Scheme objects into the
objects themselves.  That is, it is a parser for the non-terminal
<datum> (see sections @pxref{External representation} and
@pxref{Pairs and lists}).  It returns the next
object parsable from the given textual input @var{port}, updating
@var{port} to point to
the first character past the end of the external representation of the object.

Implementations may support extended syntax to represent record types or
other types that do not have datum representations.

If an end of file is encountered in the input before any
characters are found that can begin an object, then an end-of-file
object is returned.  The port remains open, and further attempts
to read will also return an end-of-file object.  If an end of file is
encountered after the beginning of an object's external representation,
but the external representation is incomplete and therefore not parsable,
an error that satisfies @samp{read-error?} is signaled.

@end deffn


@deffn {procedure} read-char 
@deffnx {procedure} read-char  port

Returns the next character available from the textual input @var{port},
updating
the @var{port} to point to the following character.  If no more characters
are available, an end-of-file object is returned.  

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} peek-char 
@deffnx {procedure} peek-char  port

Returns the next character available from the textual input @var{port},
but @emph{without} updating
the @var{port} to point to the following character.  If no more characters
are available, an end-of-file object is returned.  


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The value returned by a call to @samp{peek-char} is the same as the
value that would have been returned by a call to @samp{read-char} with the
same @var{port}.  The only difference is that the very next call to
@samp{read-char} or @samp{peek-char} on that @var{port} will return the
value returned by the preceding call to @samp{peek-char}.  In particular, a call
to @samp{peek-char} on an interactive port will hang waiting for input
whenever a call to @samp{read-char} would have hung.
@end quotation


@end deffn


@deffn {procedure} read-line 
@deffnx {procedure} read-line  port

Returns the next line of text available from the textual input
@var{port}, updating the @var{port} to point to the following character.
If an end of line is read, a string containing all of the text up to
(but not including) the end of line is returned, and the port is updated
to point just past the end of line. If an end of file is encountered
before any end of line is read, but some characters have been
read, a string containing those characters is returned. If an end of
file is encountered before any characters are read, an end-of-file
object is returned.  For the purpose of this procedure, an end of line
consists of either a linefeed character, a carriage return character, or a
sequence of a carriage return character followed by a linefeed character.
Implementations may also recognize other end of line characters or sequences.

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} eof-object?  obj

Returns @t{#t} if @var{obj} is an end-of-file object, otherwise returns
@t{#f}.  The precise set of end-of-file objects will vary among
implementations, but in any case no end-of-file object will ever be an object
that can be read in using @samp{read}.

@end deffn


@deffn {procedure} eof-object 

Returns an end-of-file object, not necessarily unique.

@end deffn



@deffn {procedure} char-ready? 
@deffnx {procedure} char-ready?  port

Returns @t{#t} if a character is ready on the textual input @var{port} and
returns @t{#f} otherwise.  If @samp{char-ready} returns @t{#t} then
the next @samp{read-char} operation on the given @var{port} is guaranteed
not to hang.  If the @var{port} is at end of file then @samp{char-ready?}
returns @t{#t}.  


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
The @samp{char-ready?} procedure exists to make it possible for a program to
accept characters from interactive ports without getting stuck waiting for
input.  Any input editors associated with such ports must ensure that
characters whose existence has been asserted by @samp{char-ready?} cannot
be removed from the input.  If @samp{char-ready?} were to return @t{#f} at end of
file, a port at end of file would be indistinguishable from an interactive
port that has no ready characters.

If no characters are available before the end of file,
an end-of-file object is returned.

Reads the next end - start bytes, or as many as are available
before the end of file,
from the binary
input @var{port} into @var{bytevector} in left-to-right order
beginning at the @var{start} position.  If @var{end} is not supplied,

@deffn {write library procedure} write  obj
@deffnx {write library procedure} write  obj port

Writes a representation of @var{obj} to the given textual output
@var{port}.  Strings
that appear in the written representation are enclosed in quotation marks, and
within those strings backslash and quotation mark characters are
escaped by backslashes.  Symbols that contain non-ASCII characters
are escaped with vertical lines.
Character objects are written using the @samp{#\} notation.

If @var{obj} contains cycles which would cause an infinite loop using
the normal written representation, then at least the objects that form
part of the cycle must be represented using datum labels as described
in section @ref{Datum labels}.  Datum labels must not be used if there
are no cycles.

Implementations may support extended syntax to represent record types or
other types that do not have datum representations.

The @samp{write} procedure returns an unspecified value.

@end deffn


@deffn {write library procedure} write-shared  obj
@deffnx {write library procedure} write-shared  obj port

The @samp{write-shared} procedure is the same as @samp{write}, except that
shared structure must be represented using datum labels for all pairs
and vectors that appear more than once in the output.

@end deffn


@deffn {write library procedure} write-simple  obj
@deffnx {write library procedure} write-simple  obj port

The @samp{write-simple} procedure is the same as @samp{write}, except that shared structure is
never represented using datum labels.  This can cause @samp{write-simple} not to
terminate if @var{obj} contains circular structure.

@end deffn



@deffn {write library procedure} display  obj
@deffnx {write library procedure} display  obj port

Writes a representation of @var{obj} to the given textual output @var{port}.
Strings that appear in the written representation are output as if by
@samp{write-string} instead of by @samp{write}.
Symbols are not escaped.  Character
objects appear in the representation as if written by @samp{write-char}
instead of by @samp{write}.

The @samp{display} representation of other objects is unspecified.
However, @samp{display} must not loop forever on 
self-referencing pairs, vectors, or records.  Thus if the
normal @samp{write} representation is used, datum labels are needed
to represent cycles as in @samp{write}.

Implementations may support extended syntax to represent record types or
other types that do not have datum representations.

The @samp{display} procedure returns an unspecified value.


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
The @samp{write} procedure is intended
for producing mach@-ine-readable output and @samp{display} for producing
human-readable output.

@deffn {procedure} write-char  char

@deffn {procedure} write-string  string
@deffnx {procedure} write-string  string port

@section System interface

@cindex @w{system interface}

Questions of system interface generally fall outside of the domain of this
report.  However, the following operations are important enough to
deserve description here.



@deffn {load library procedure} load  filename
@deffnx {load library procedure} load  filename environment-specifier

It is an error if @var{filename} is not a string.
An implementation-dependent operation is used to transform
@var{filename} into the name of an existing file
containing Scheme source code.  The @samp{load} procedure reads
expressions and definitions from the file and evaluates them
sequentially in the environment specified by @var{environment-specifier}.
If @var{environment-specifier} is omitted, @samp{(interaction-environment)}
is assumed.

It is unspecified whether the results of the expressions
are printed.  The @samp{load} procedure does not affect the values
returned by @samp{current-input-port} and @samp{current-output-port}.
It returns an unspecified value.



@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
For portability, @samp{load} must operate on source files.
Its operation on other kinds of files necessarily varies among
implementations.
@end quotation

@end deffn


@deffn {file library procedure} file-exists?  filename

It is an error if @var{filename} is not a string.
The @samp{file-exists?} procedure returns
@t{#t} if the named file exists at the time the procedure is called,
and @t{#f} otherwise.

@end deffn


@deffn {file library procedure} delete-file  filename

It is an error if @var{filename} is not a string.
The @samp{delete-file} procedure deletes the
named file if it exists and can be deleted, and returns an unspecified
value.  If the file does not exist or cannot be deleted, an error
that satisfies @samp{file-error?} is signaled.

@end deffn


@deffn {process-context library procedure} command-line 

Returns the command line passed to the process as a list of
strings.  The first string corresponds to the command name, and is
implementation-dependent.  It is an error to mutate any of these strings.
@end deffn


@deffn {process-context library procedure} exit 
@deffnx {process-context library procedure} exit  obj

Runs all outstanding dynamic-wind @var{after} procedures, terminates the
running program, and communicates an exit value to the operating system.
If no argument is supplied, or if @var{obj} is @t{#t}, the @samp{exit} procedure should communicate to the operating system that the
program exited normally.  If @var{obj} is @t{#f}, the @samp{exit}
procedure should communicate to the operating system that the program
exited abnormally.  Otherwise, @samp{exit} should translate @var{obj} into
an appropriate exit value for the operating system, if possible.

The @samp{exit} procedure
must not signal an exception or return to its continuation.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
Because of the requirement to run handlers, this procedure is not just the
operating system's exit procedure.
@end quotation


@end deffn


@deffn {process-context library procedure} emergency-exit 
@deffnx {process-context library procedure} emergency-exit  obj

Terminates the program without running any
outstanding dynamic-wind @var{after} procedures
and communicates an exit value to the operating system
in the same manner as @samp{exit}.


@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The @samp{emergency-exit} procedure corresponds to the @samp{ exit} procedure
in Windows and Posix.

@ignore todo
Shinn: Do we need any description of what an environment variable is?
@end ignore



@deffn {process-context library procedure} get-environment-variable  name

Many operating systems provide each running process with an
@dfn{environment} consisting of @dfn{environment variables}.
@cindex @w{environment variables}
@cindex @w{environment}
(This environment is not to be confused with the Scheme environments that
can be passed to @samp{eval}: see section @pxref{Environments and evaluation}.)
Both the name and value of an environment variable are strings.
The procedure @samp{get-environment-variable} returns the value 
of the environment variable @var{name},
or @t{#f} if the named
environment variable is not found.  It may
use locale information to encode the name and decode the value
of the environment variable.  It is an error if 
@samp{get-environment-variable} can't decode the value.
It is also an error to mutate the resulting string.


@format
@t{(get-environment-variable "PATH") 
          ==> "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
}
@end format


@end deffn


@deffn {process-context library procedure} get-environment-variables 

Returns the names and values of all the environment variables as an
alist, where the car of each entry is the name of an environment
variable and the cdr is its value, both as strings.  The order of the list is unspecified.
It is an error to mutate any of these strings or the alist itself.


@format
@t{(get-environment-variables) 
          ==> (("USER" . "root") ("HOME" . "/"))
}
@end format


@end deffn


@deffn {time library procedure} current-second 

Returns an inexact number representing the current time on the International Atomic
Time (TAI) scale.  The value 0.0 represents midnight
on January 1, 1970 TAI (equivalent to 8.000082 seconds before midnight Universal Time)
and the value 1.0 represents one TAI
second later.  Neither high accuracy nor high precision are required; in particular,
returning Coordinated Universal Time plus a suitable constant might be
the best an implementation can do.

As of 2018, a TAI-UTC offset table can be found at [TAI].
@end deffn


@deffn {time library procedure} current-jiffy 

Returns the number of @dfn{jiffies} as an exact integer that have elapsed since an arbitrary,
@cindex @w{jiffies}
implementation-defined epoch. A jiffy is an implementation-defined
fraction of a second which is defined by the return value of the
@samp{jiffies-per-second} procedure. The starting epoch is guaranteed to be
constant during a run of the program, but may vary between runs.


@quotation
@emph{Rationale:}
Jiffies are allowed to be implementation-dependent so that
@samp{current-jiffy} can execute with minimum overhead. It
should be very likely that a compactly represented integer will suffice
as the returned value.  Any particular jiffy size will be inappropriate
for some implementations: a microsecond is too long for a very fast
machine, while a much smaller unit would force many implementations to
return integers which have to be allocated for most calls, rendering 
@samp{current-jiffy} less useful for accurate timing measurements.
@end quotation


@end deffn


@deffn {time library procedure} jiffies-per-second 

Returns an exact integer representing the number of jiffies per SI
second. This value is an implementation-specified constant.

@cindex @w{formal syntax}


This section provides a formal syntax for Scheme written in an extended
BNF.

All spaces in the grammar are for legibility.  Case is not significant
except in the definitions of <letter>, <character name> and <mnemonic escape>; for example, @samp{#x1A}
and @samp{#X1a} are equivalent, but @samp{foo} and @samp{Foo}
and @samp{#\space} and @samp{#\Space} are distinct.
<empty> stands for the empty string.

The following extensions to BNF are used to make the description more
concise:  <thing>* means zero or more occurrences of
<thing>; and <thing>+ means at least one
<thing>.


@node Lexical structure, External representation, Formal syntax, Formal syntax
@subsection Lexical structure

@cindex @w{lexical structure}

This section describes how individual tokens (identifiers,
@cindex @w{token}
numbers, etc.) are formed from sequences of characters.  The following
sections describe how expressions and programs are formed from sequences
of tokens.

<Intertoken space> can occur on either side of any token, but not
within a token.

Identifiers that do not begin with a vertical line are
terminated by a <delimiter> or by the end of the input.
So are dot, numbers, characters, and booleans.
Identifiers that begin with a vertical line are terminated by another vertical line.

The following four characters from the ASCII repertoire
are reserved for future extensions to the
language: @t{[ ] @{ @}}

In addition to the identifier characters of the ASCII repertoire specified
below, Scheme implementations may permit any additional repertoire of
non-ASCII Unicode characters to be employed in identifiers,
provided that each such character has a Unicode general category of Lu,
Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Mn, Mc, Me, Nd, Nl, No, Pd, Pc, Po, Sc, Sm, Sk, So,
or Co, or is U+200C or U+200D (the zero-width non-joiner and joiner,
respectively, which are needed for correct spelling in Persian, Hindi,
and other languages).
However, it is an error for the first character to have a general category
of Nd, Mc, or Me.  It is also an error to use a non-Unicode character
in symbols or identifiers.

All Scheme implementations must permit the escape sequence
@t{\x<hexdigits>;}
to appear in Scheme identifiers that are enclosed in vertical lines. If the character
with the given Unicode scalar value is supported by the implementation,
identifiers containing such a sequence are equivalent to identifiers
containing the corresponding character.

@subsection Quasiquotations

@cindex @w{quasiquotations}

The following grammar for quasiquote expressions is not context-free.
It is presented as a recipe for generating an infinite number of
production rules.  Imagine a copy of the following rules for D = 1, 2,3, @dots{}, where D is the nesting depth.


@format
@t{<quasiquotation> --> <quasiquotation 1>
<qq template 0> --> <expression>
<quasiquotation D> --> `<qq template D>
       | (quasiquote <qq template D>)
<qq template D> --> <simple datum>
       | <list qq template D>
       | <vector qq template D>
       | <unquotation D>
<list qq template D> --> (<qq template or splice D>*)
       | (<qq template or splice D>+ .@: <qq template D>)
       | '<qq template D>
       | <quasiquotation D+1>
<vector qq template D> --> #(<qq template or splice D>*)
<unquotation D> --> ,<qq template D-1>
       | (unquote <qq template D-1>)
<qq template or splice D> --> <qq template D>
       | <splicing unquotation D>
<splicing unquotation D> --> ,@@<qq template D-1>
       | (unquote-splicing <qq template D-1>) }

@end format



In <quasiquotation>s, a <list qq template D> can sometimes
be confused with either an <un@-quota@-tion D> or a <splicing
un@-quo@-ta@-tion D>.  The interpretation as an
<un@-quo@-ta@-tion> or <splicing
un@-quo@-ta@-tion D> takes precedence.

This section gives syntax definitions for the derived expression types in
terms of the primitive expression types (literal, variable, call, @samp{lambda},
@samp{if}, and @samp{set!}), except for @samp{quasiquote}.

Conditional derived syntax types:


@example

(define-syntax cond
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((cond (else result1 result2 ...))
     (begin result1 result2 ...))
    ((cond (test => result))
     (let ((temp test))

    ((cond (test => result) clause1 clause2 ...)
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp
           (result temp)
           (cond clause1 clause2 ...))))
    ((cond (test)) test)
    ((cond (test) clause1 clause2 ...)
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp
           temp
           (cond clause1 clause2 ...))))
    ((cond (test result1 result2 ...))
     (if test (begin result1 result2 ...)))
    ((cond (test result1 result2 ...)
           clause1 clause2 ...)
     (if test
         (begin result1 result2 ...)
         (cond clause1 clause2 ...)))))

@end example

(define-syntax case
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((case (key ...)
       clauses ...)
     (let ((atom-key (key ...)))
       (case atom-key clauses ...)))
    ((case key
       (else => result))
     (result key))

  (syntax-rules ()
    ((unless test result1 result2 ...)
     (if (not test)

@end example


Binding constructs:


@example

(define-syntax let
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     ((lambda (name ...) body1 body2 ...)
      val ...))
    ((let tag ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     ((letrec ((tag (lambda (name ...)
                      body1 body2 ...)))
        tag)
      val ...))))

@end example



@example

(define-syntax let*
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let* () body1 body2 ...)
     (let () body1 body2 ...))
    ((let* ((name1 val1) (name2 val2) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((name1 val1))
       (let* ((name2 val2) ...)
         body1 body2 ...)))))

@end example


The following @samp{letrec} macro uses the symbol @samp{<undefined>}
in place of an expression which returns something that when stored in
a location makes it an error to try to obtain the value stored in the
location.  (No such expression is defined in Scheme.)
A trick is used to generate the temporary names needed to avoid
specifying the order in which the values are evaluated.
This could also be accomplished by using an auxiliary macro.


@example

(define-syntax letrec
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec ((var1 init1) ...) body ...)
     (letrec "generate temp names"
       (var1 ...)
       ()
       ((var1 init1) ...)
       body ...))
    ((letrec "generate temp names"
       ()
       (temp1 ...)
       ((var1 init1) ...)
       body ...)
     (let ((var1 <undefined>) ...)
       (let ((temp1 init1) ...)
         (set! var1 temp1)
         ...
         body ...)))
    ((letrec "generate temp names"
       (x y ...)
       (temp ...)
       ((var1 init1) ...)
       body ...)
     (letrec "generate temp names"
       (y ...)
       (newtemp temp ...)
       ((var1 init1) ...)
       body ...))))

@end example



@example

(define-syntax letrec*
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec* ((var1 init1) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((var1 <undefined>) ...)
       (set! var1 init1)
       ...
       (let () body1 body2 ...)))))

@end example

  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let-values (binding ...) body0 body1 ...)
     (let-values "bind"
         (binding ...) () (begin body0 body1 ...)))
    
    ((let-values "bind" () tmps body)

@end example



@example

(define-syntax begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((begin exp ...)
     ((lambda () exp ...)))))

@end example


The following alternative expansion for @samp{begin} does not make use of
the ability to write more than one expression in the body of a lambda
expression.  In any case, note that these rules apply only if the body
of the @samp{begin} contains no definitions.


@example

(define-syntax begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((begin exp)
     exp)
    ((begin exp1 exp2 ...)
     (call-with-values
         (lambda () exp1)
       (lambda args
         (begin exp2 ...))))))

@end example


The following syntax definition
of @samp{do} uses a trick to expand the variable clauses.
As with @samp{letrec} above, an auxiliary macro would also work.
The expression @samp{(if #f #f)} is used to obtain an unspecific
value.


@example

(define-syntax do
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((do ((var init step ...) ...)
         (test expr ...)
         command ...)
     (letrec
       ((loop
         (lambda (var ...)
           (if test
               (begin
                 (if #f #f)
                 expr ...)
               (begin
                 command
                 ...
                 (loop (do "step" var step ...)
                       ...))))))
       (loop init ...)))
    ((do "step" x)
     x)
    ((do "step" x y)
     y)))

@end example


Here is a possible implementation of @samp{delay}, @samp{force} and @samp{delay-force}.  We define the expression


@example

(delay-force @r{<expression>})

@end example


to have the same meaning as the procedure call


@example

(make-promise #f (lambda () @r{<expression>}))

@end example


as follows


@example

(define-syntax delay-force
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((delay-force expression) 
     (make-promise #f (lambda () expression)))))

@end example


and we define the expression


@example

(delay @r{<expression>})

@end example


to have the same meaning as:


@example

(delay-force (make-promise #t @r{<expression>}))

@end example


as follows


@example

(define-syntax delay
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((delay expression)
     (delay-force (make-promise #t expression)))))

@end example


where @samp{make-promise} is defined as follows:


@example

(define make-promise
  (lambda (done? proc)
    (list (cons done? proc))))

@end example


Finally, we define @samp{force} to call the procedure expressions in
promises iteratively using a trampoline technique following
[srfi45] until a non-lazy result (i.e. a value created by @samp{delay} instead of @samp{delay-force}) is returned, as follows:


@example

(define (force promise)
  (if (promise-done? promise)
      (promise-value promise)
      (let ((promise* ((promise-value promise))))
        (unless (promise-done? promise)
          (promise-update! promise* promise))
        (force promise))))

@end example


with the following promise accessors:


@example

(define promise-done?
  (lambda (x) (car (car x))))
(define promise-value
  (lambda (x) (cdr (car x))))
(define promise-update!
  (lambda (new old)
    (set-car! (car old) (promise-done? new))
    (set-cdr! (car old) (promise-value new))
    (set-car! new (car old))))

@end example


The following implementation of @samp{make-parameter} and @samp{parameterize} is suitable for an implementation with no threads.
Parameter objects are implemented here as procedures, using two
arbitrary unique objects @t{<param-set!>} and
@t{<param-convert>}:


@example

(define (make-parameter init . o)
  (let* ((converter
          (if (pair? o) (car o) (lambda (x) x)))
         (value (converter init)))
    (lambda args
      (cond
       ((null? args)
        value)
       ((eq? (car args) <param-set!>)
        (set! value (cadr args)))
       ((eq? (car args) <param-convert>)
        converter)
       (else
        (error "bad parameter syntax"))))))

@end example


Then @samp{parameterize} uses @samp{dynamic-wind} to dynamically rebind
the associated value:


@example

(define-syntax parameterize
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((parameterize ("step")
                   ((param value p old new) ...)
                   ()
                   body)
     (let ((p param) ...)
       (let ((old (p)) ...
             (new ((p <param-convert>) value)) ...)
         (dynamic-wind
          (lambda () (p <param-set!> new) ...)
          (lambda () . body)
          (lambda () (p <param-set!> old) ...)))))
    ((parameterize ("step")
                   args
                   ((param value) . rest)
                   body)
     (parameterize ("step")
                   ((param value p old new) . args)
                   rest
                   body))
    ((parameterize ((param value) ...) . body)
     (parameterize ("step")
                   ()
                   ((param value) ...)
                   body))))

@end example


The following implementation of @samp{guard} depends on an auxiliary
macro, here called @samp{guard-aux}.


@example

(define-syntax guard
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((guard (var clause ...) e1 e2 ...)
     ((call/cc
       (lambda (guard-k)
         (with-exception-handler
          (lambda (condition)
            ((call/cc
               (lambda (handler-k)
                 (guard-k
                  (lambda ()
                    (let ((var condition))
                      (guard-aux
                        (handler-k
                          (lambda ()
                            (raise-continuable condition)))
                        clause ...))))))))
          (lambda ()
            (call-with-values
             (lambda () e1 e2 ...)
             (lambda args
               (guard-k
                 (lambda ()
                   (apply values args)))))))))))))

(define-syntax guard-aux
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((guard-aux reraise (else result1 result2 ...))
     (begin result1 result2 ...))
    ((guard-aux reraise (test => result))
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp 
           (result temp)

This definition of @samp{cond-expand} does not interact with the 
@samp{features} procedure.  It requires that each feature identifier provided
by the implementation be explicitly mentioned.


@example

@chapter Standard Libraries

@cindex @w{standard libraries}


@c % Note, this is used to generate stdmod.tex.  The bindings could be
@c % extracted automatically from the document, but this lets us choose
@c % the ordering and optionally format manually where needed.

This section lists the exports provided by the standard libraries.  The
libraries are factored so as to separate features which might not be
supported by all implementations, or which might be expensive to load.

The @samp{scheme} library prefix is used for all standard libraries, and
is reserved for use by future standards.

@b{Base Library}

The @t{(scheme base)} library exports many of the procedures and
syntax bindings that are traditionally associated with Scheme.
The division between the base library and the other standard libraries is
based on use, not on construction. In particular, some facilities that are
typically implemented as primitives by a compiler or the run-time system
rather than in terms of other standard procedures or syntax are
not part of the base library, but are defined in separate libraries.
By the same token, some exports of the base library are implementable
in terms of other exports.  They are redundant in the strict sense of
the word, but they capture common patterns of usage, and are therefore
provided as convenient abbreviations.

The @t{(scheme file)} library provides procedures for accessing
files.


@example

@samp{call-with-input-file}    @samp{call-with-output-file}
@samp{delete-file}             @samp{file-exists?}
@samp{open-binary-input-file}  @samp{open-binary-output-file}
@samp{open-input-file}         @samp{open-output-file}
@samp{with-input-from-file}    @samp{with-output-to-file}

@end example


@b{Inexact Library}

@samp{nan? }                   @samp{sin}
@samp{sqrt}                    @samp{tan}

@end example


@b{Lazy Library}

The @t{(scheme lazy)} library exports procedures and syntax keywords for lazy evaluation.

@end example


@b{Write Library}

The @t{(scheme write)} library provides procedures for writing
Scheme objects.


@example

@samp{display}                 @samp{write}
@samp{write-shared}            @samp{write-simple}

@end example


@b{R5RS Library}

The @t{(scheme r5rs)} library provides the identifiers defined by
R@sup{5}RS, except that
@samp{transcript-on} and @samp{transcript-off} are not present.
Note that
the @samp{exact} and @samp{inexact} procedures appear under their R@sup{5}RS names
@samp{inexact->exact} and @samp{exact->inexact} respectively.
However, if an implementation does not provide a particular library such as the
complex library, the corresponding identifiers will not appear in this
library either.


@example

@samp{*}                       @samp{+}
@samp{-}                       @samp{...}
@samp{/}                       @samp{<}

This section enumerates the incompatibilities between this report and
the ``Revised^5 report'' [R5RS].

@emph{This list is not authoritative, but is believed to be correct and complete.}




@itemize @bullet


@item
Case sensitivity is now the default in symbols and character names.
This means that code written under the assumption that symbols could be
written @samp{FOO} or @samp{Foo} in some contexts and @samp{foo} in other contexts
can either be changed, be marked with the new @samp{#!fold-case} directive,
or be included in a library using the @samp{include-ci} library declaration.
All standard identifiers are entirely in lower case.

@item
The @samp{syntax-rules} construct now recognizes @emph{ } (underscore) 
as a wildcard, which means it cannot be used as a syntax variable.
It can still be used as a literal.

@item
The R@sup{5}RS procedures @samp{exact->inexact} and @samp{inexact->exact}
have been renamed to their R@sup{6}RS names, @samp{inexact} and @samp{exact},
respectively, as these names are shorter and more correct.
The former names are still available in the R@sup{5}RS library.

@item
The guarantee that string comparison (with @samp{string<?} and the
related predicates) is a lexicographical extension of character comparison
(with @samp{char<?} and the related predicates) has been removed.  

@item
Support for the # character in numeric literals is no longer required.

@item
Support for the letters @samp{s}, @samp{f}, @samp{d}, and @samp{l}
as exponent markers is no longer required.

@item
Implementations of @samp{string->number} are no longer permitted
to return @t{#f} when the argument contains an explicit radix prefix,
and must be compatible with @samp{read} and the syntax of numbers in programs.

@item
The procedures @samp{transcript-on} and @samp{transcript-off} have been removed.

@emph{This list is not authoritative, but is believed to be correct and complete.}



@itemize @bullet


@item
Various minor ambiguities and unclarities in R@sup{5}RS have been cleaned up.

@item
Libraries have been added as a new program structure to improve
encapsulation and sharing of code.  Some existing and new identifiers
have been factored out into separate libraries.
Libraries can be imported into other libraries or main programs, with
controlled exposure and renaming of identifiers.
The contents of a library can be made conditional on the features of
the implementation on which it is to be used.
There is an R@sup{5}RS compatibility library.

@item
The expressions types @samp{include}, @samp{include-ci}, and @samp{cond-expand}
have been added to the base library; they have the same semantics as the
corresponding library declarations.

@item
Exceptions can now be signaled explicitly with @samp{raise},
@samp{raise-continuable} or @samp{error}, and can be handled with @samp{with-exception-handler} and the @samp{guard} syntax.
Any object can specify an error condition; the implementation-defined
conditions signaled by @samp{error} have a predicate to detect them and accessor functions to
retrieve the arguments passed to @samp{error}.
Conditions signaled by @samp{read} and by file-related procedures
also have predicates to detect them.

@item
New disjoint types supporting access to multiple fields can be
generated with the @samp{define-record-type} of SRFI 9 [srfi9]

@item
Parameter objects can be created with @samp{make-parameter}, and
dynamically rebound with @samp{parameterize}.
The procedures @samp{current-input-port} and @samp{current-output-port} are now
parameter objects, as is the newly introduced @samp{current-error-port}.

@item
Support for promises has been enhanced based on SRFI 45 [srfi45].

@item
@emph{Bytevectors}, vectors of exact integers in the range
from 0 to 255 inclusive, have been added as a new disjoint type.
A subset of the vector procedures is provided.  Bytevectors
can be converted to and from strings in accordance with the UTF-8 character encoding.
Bytevectors have a datum representation and evaluate to themselves.

@item
Vector constants evaluate to themselves.

@item
The procedure @samp{read-line} is provided to make line-oriented textual input
simpler.

@item
The procedure @samp{flush-output-port} is provided to allow minimal
control of output port buffering.

@item
@emph{Ports} can now be designated as @emph{textual} or @emph{binary} ports, with new procedures for reading and writing binary
data.
The new predicates @samp{input-port-open?} and @samp{output-port-open?} return whether a port is open or closed.
The new procedure @samp{close-port} now closes a port; if the port
has both input and output sides, both are closed.

@item
@emph{String ports} have been added as a way to read and write
characters to and from strings, and @emph{bytevector ports} to read
and write bytes to and from bytevectors.

@item
There are now I/O procedures specific to strings and bytevectors.

@item
The @samp{write} procedure now generates datum labels when applied to
circular objects.  The new procedure @samp{write-simple} never generates
labels; @samp{write-shared} generates labels for all shared and circular
structure.
The @samp{display} procedure must not loop on circular objects.

@item
The R@sup{6}RS procedure @samp{eof-object} has been added.
Eof-objects are now required to be a disjoint type.

@item
Syntax definitions are now allowed wherever variable definitions are.

@item
The @samp{syntax-rules} construct now allows
the ellipsis symbol to be specified explicitly instead of the default
@samp{...}, allows template escapes with an ellipsis-prefixed list, and
allows tail patterns to follow an ellipsis pattern.

@item
The @samp{syntax-error} syntax has been added as a way to signal immediate
and more informative errors when a macro is expanded.

@item
The @samp{letrec*} binding construct has been added, and internal @samp{define} 
is specified in terms of it.

@item
Support for capturing multiple values has been enhanced with @samp{define-values}, @samp{let-values}, and @samp{let*-values}.
Standard expression types which contain a sequence of expressions now
permit passing zero or more than one value to the continuations of all
non-final expressions of the sequence.

@item
The @samp{case} conditional now supports @t{=>} syntax
analogous to @samp{cond} not only in regular clauses but in the @samp{else} clause as well.

@item
To support dispatching on the number of arguments passed to a
procedure, @samp{case-lambda} has been added in its own library.

@item
The convenience conditionals @samp{when} and @samp{unless} have been added.

@item
The behavior of @samp{eqv?} on inexact numbers now conforms to the
R@sup{6}RS definition.

@item
When applied to procedures, @samp{eq?} and @samp{eqv?} are permitted to
return different answers.

@item
The R@sup{6}RS procedures @samp{boolean=?} and @samp{symbol=?} have been added.

@item
Positive infinity, negative infinity, NaN, and negative inexact zero have been added
to the numeric tower as inexact values with the written
representations @t{+inf.0}, @t{-inf.0}, @t{+nan.0}, and @samp{-0.0}
respectively.  Support for them is not required.
The representation @t{-nan.0} is synonymous with @t{+nan.0}.

@item
The @samp{log} procedure now accepts a second argument specifying
the logarithm base.

@item
The procedures @samp{map} and @samp{for-each} are now required to terminate on
the shortest argument list.

@item
The procedures @samp{member} and @samp{assoc} now take an optional third argument
specifying the equality predicate to be used.

@item
The numeric procedures @samp{finite?}, @samp{infinite?}, @samp{nan?},
@samp{exact-integer?}, @samp{square}, and @samp{exact-integer-sqrt}
have been added.

@item
The @samp{-} and @samp{/} procedures
and the character and string comparison
predicates are now required to support more than two arguments.

@item
The forms @t{#true} and @t{#false} are now supported
as well as @t{#t} and @t{#f}.

@item
The procedures @samp{make-list}, @samp{list-copy}, @samp{list-set!},
@samp{string-map}, @samp{string-for-each}, @samp{string->vector}, 
@samp{vector-append},
@samp{vector-copy}, @samp{vector-map}, @samp{vector-for-each}, 
@samp{vector->string}, @samp{vector-copy!}, and @samp{string-copy!}
have been added to round out the sequence operations.

@item
Some string and vector procedures support processing of part of a string or vector using
optional @var{start} and @var{end} arguments.

@item
Some list procedures are now defined on circular lists.

@item
Implementations may provide any subset of the full Unicode
repertoire that includes ASCII, but implementations must support any
such subset in a way consistent with Unicode.
Various character and string procedures have been extended accordingly,
and case conversion procedures added for strings.
String comparison is no longer
required to be consistent with character comparison, which is based
solely on Unicode scalar values.
The new @samp{digit-value} procedure has been added to obtain the numerical
value of a numeric character.

@item
There are now two additional comment syntaxes: @t{#;} to
skip the next datum, and @t{#| ... |#}
for nestable block comments.

@item
Data prefixed with datum labels @t{#<n>=} can be referenced
with @t{#<n>#}, allowing for reading and writing of data with
shared structure.

@item
Strings and symbols now allow mnemonic and numeric escape
sequences, and the list of named characters has been extended.

@item
The procedures @samp{file-exists?} and @samp{delete-file} are available in the
@t{(scheme file)} library.

@item
An interface to the system environment, command line, and process exit status is
available in the @t{(scheme process-context)} library.

@item
Procedures for accessing time-related values are available in the
@t{(scheme time)} library.

@item
A less irregular set of integer division operators is provided
with new and clearer names.

@item
The @samp{load} procedure now accepts a second argument specifying the environment to
load into.

@item
The @samp{call-with-current-continuation} procedure now has the synonym
@samp{call/cc}.

@item
The semantics of read-eval-print loops are now partly prescribed,
requiring the redefinition of procedures, but not syntax keywords, to have retroactive effect.

@item
The formal semantics now handles @samp{dynamic-wind}.

@unnumberedsec Incompatibilities with R@sup{6}RS

@cindex @w{incompatibilities with r@sup{6}rs}
This section enumerates the incompatibilities between R@sup{7}RS and
the ``Revised^6 report'' [R6RS] and its accompanying Standard Libraries document.

@emph{This list is not authoritative, and is possibly incomplete.}



@itemize @bullet

@item
R@sup{7}RS libraries begin with the keyword @samp{define-library}
rather than @samp{library} in order to make them syntactically
distinguishable from R@sup{6}RS libraries.
In R@sup{7}RS terms, the body of an R@sup{6}RS library consists
of a single export declaration followed by a single import declaration,
followed by commands and definitions.  In R@sup{7}RS, commands and
definitions are not permitted directly within the body: they have to be wrapped in a @samp{begin}
library declaration.

@item
There is no direct R@sup{6}RS equivalent of the @samp{include}, @samp{include-ci},
@samp{include-library-declarations}, or @samp{cond-expand} library declarations.
On the other hand, the R@sup{7}RS library syntax does not support phase or version specifications.

@item
The grouping of standardized identifiers into libraries is different from the R@sup{6}RS
approach. In particular, procedures which are optional in R@sup{5}RS  either expressly
or by implication, have been removed from the base library.
Only the base library itself is an absolute requirement.

@item
No form of identifier syntax is provided. 

@item
Internal syntax definitions are allowed, but uses of a syntax form
cannot appear before its definition; the @samp{even}/@samp{odd} example given in
R@sup{6}RS is not allowed.

@item
The R@sup{6}RS exception system was incorporated as-is, but the condition
types have been left unspecified.  In particular, where R@sup{6}RS requires
a condition of a specified type to be signaled, R@sup{7}RS says only
``it is an error'', leaving the question of signaling open.

@item
Full Unicode support is not required.
Normalization is not provided.
Character comparisons are
defined by Unicode, but string comparisons are implementation-dependent.
Non-Unicode characters are permitted.

@item
The full numeric tower is optional as in R@sup{5}RS, but optional support for IEEE
infinities, NaN, and mbox -0.0 was adopted from R@sup{6}RS. Most clarifications on
numeric results were also adopted, but the semantics of the R@sup{6}RS procedures @samp{real?},
@samp{rational?}, and @samp{integer}? were not adopted.
(Note that the R@sup{5}RS/R@sup{7}RS semantics are available in R@sup{6}RS using
@samp{real-valued?}, @samp{rational-valued?}, and @samp{integer-valued?}).
The R@sup{6}RS division operators @samp{div}, @samp{mod}, @samp{div-and-mod}, @samp{div0}, @samp{mod0} and @samp{div0-and-mod0} are not provided.

@item
When a result is unspecified, it is still required to be a single value.
However, non-final expressions
in a body can return any number of values.

@item
The semantics of @samp{map} and @samp{for-each} have been changed to use
the SRFI 1 [srfi1] early termination behavior. Likewise,
@samp{assoc} and @samp{member} take an optional @samp{equal?} argument as in SRFI 1,
instead of the separate @samp{assp} and @samp{memp} procedures of R@sup{6}RS.

@item
The R@sup{6}RS @samp{quasiquote} clarifications have been adopted, with the
exception of multiple-argument @samp{unquote} and
@samp{unquote-splicing}.

@item
The R@sup{6}RS method of specifying mantissa widths was not adopted.

@item
String ports are compatible with SRFI 6 [srfi6] rather than R@sup{6}RS.

@item
R@sup{6}RS-style bytevectors are included, but 
only the unsigned byte (@samp{u8}) procedures have been provided.
The lexical syntax uses @samp{#u8} for compatibility
with SRFI 4 [srfi4], rather than the R@sup{6}RS @samp{#vu8} style.

@item
The utility macros @samp{when} and @samp{unless} are provided, but 
their result is left unspecified.

@item
The remaining features of the Standard Libraries document were
left to future standardization efforts.

@cindex @w{example}

The procedure @samp{integrate-system} integrates the system 


@center y_k^^ = f_k(y_1, y_2, @dots{}, y_n),    k = 1, @dots{}, n

of differential equations with the method of Runge-Kutta.

The parameter @t{system-derivative} is a function that takes a system
state (a vector of values for the state variables y_1, @dots{}, y_n)
and produces a system derivative (the values y_1^^, @dots{},y_n^^).  The parameter @t{initial-state} provides an initial
system state, and @t{h} is an initial guess for the length of the
integration step.

The value returned by @samp{integrate-system} is an infinite stream of
system states.


@example

(define (integrate-system system-derivative
                          initial-state
                          h)
  (let ((next (runge-kutta-4 system-derivative h)))
    (letrec ((states
              (cons initial-state
                    (delay (map-streams next
                                        states)))))
      states)))

@end example


The procedure @samp{runge-kutta-4} takes a function, @t{f}, that produces a
system derivative from a system state.  It
produces a function that takes a system state and
produces a new system state.


@example

(define (runge-kutta-4 f h)
  (let ((*h (scale-vector h))
        (*2 (scale-vector 2))
        (*1/2 (scale-vector (/ 1 2)))
        (*1/6 (scale-vector (/ 1 6))))
    (lambda (y)
      ;; y is a system state
      (let* ((k0 (*h (f y)))
             (k1 (*h (f (add-vectors y (*1/2 k0)))))
             (k2 (*h (f (add-vectors y (*1/2 k1)))))
             (k3 (*h (f (add-vectors y k2)))))
        (add-vectors y
          (*1/6 (add-vectors k0
                             (*2 k1)
                             (*2 k2)
                             k3)))))))

(define (elementwise f)
  (lambda vectors
    (generate-vector
     (vector-length (car vectors))
     (lambda (i)
       (apply f
              (map (lambda (v) (vector-ref  v i))
                   vectors))))))

(define (generate-vector size proc)
  (let ((ans (make-vector size)))
    (letrec ((loop
              (lambda (i)
                (cond ((= i size) ans)
                      (else
                       (vector-set! ans i (proc i))
                       (loop (+ i 1)))))))
      (loop 0))))

(define add-vectors (elementwise +))

(define (scale-vector s)
  (elementwise (lambda (x) (* x s))))

@end example


The @samp{map-streams} procedure is analogous to @samp{map}: it applies its first
argument (a procedure) to all the elements of its second argument (a
stream).


@example

(define (map-streams f s)
  (cons (f (head s))
        (delay (map-streams f (tail s)))))

@end example


Infinite streams are implemented as pairs whose car holds the first
element of the stream and whose cdr holds a promise to deliver the rest
of the stream.


@example

(define head car)
(define (tail stream)
  (force (cdr stream)))

@end example


@sp 6
The following illustrates the use of @samp{integrate-system} in
integrating the system


@center  C dv_C / dt = -i_L - v_C / R



@center  L di_L / dt = v_C

which models a damped oscillator.


@example

(define (damped-oscillator R L C)
  (lambda (state)
    (let ((Vc (vector-ref state 0))
          (Il (vector-ref state 1)))
      (vector (- 0 (+ (/ Vc (* R C)) (/ Il C)))
              (/ Vc L)))))

(define the-states
  (integrate-system
     (damped-oscillator 10000 1000 .001)
     '#(1 0)
     .01))

@end example

@c  My reference for proper reference format is:
@c     Mary-Claire van Leunen.
@c     {\em A Handbook for Scholars.}
@c     Knopf, 1978.
@c  I think the references list would look better in ``open'' format,
@c  i.e. with the three blocks for each entry appearing on separate
@c  lines.  I used the compressed format for SIGPLAN in the interest of
@c  space.  In open format, when a block runs over one line,
@c  continuation lines should be indented; this could probably be done
@c  using some flavor of latex list environment.  Maybe the right thing
@c  to do in the long run would be to convert to Bibtex, which probably
@c  does the right thing, since it was implemented by one of van
@c  Leunen's colleagues at DEC SRC.
@c   -- Jonathan

@c  I tried to follow Jonathan's format, insofar as I understood it.
@c  I tried to order entries lexicographically by authors (with singly
@c  authored papers first), then by date.
@c  In some cases I replaced a technical report or conference paper
@c  by a subsequent journal article, but I think there are several
@c  more such replacements that ought to be made.
@c   -- Will, 1991.

@c  This is just a personal remark on your question on the RRRS:
@c  The language CUCH (Curry-Church) was implemented by 1964 and 
@c  is a practical version of the lambda-calculus (call-by-name).
@c  One reference you may find in Formal Language Description Languages
@c  for Computer Programming T.~B.~Steele, 1965 (or so).
@c   -- Matthias Felleisen

@c  Rather than try to keep the bibliography up-to-date, which is hopeless
@c  given the time between updates, I replaced the bulk of the references
@c  with a pointer to the Scheme Repository.  Ozan Yigit's bibliography in
@c  the repository is a superset of the R4RS one.
@c  The bibliography now contains only items referenced within the report.
@c   -- Richard, 1996.

@c  Once again, the bibliography now contains only items referenced within the report.
@c   -- John Cowan, 2013
